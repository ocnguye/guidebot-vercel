CT angiogram showed a bleed in the rectum. Thrombocytopenia (18,000 platelets) precluded colonoscopy and he was taken to the IR suite for embolization under anesthesia.  Procedures: Ultrasound and fluoroscopy-guided  peritoneal catheter placement Ultrasound and fluoroscopy-guided pericardial drain placement  Findings: The CT angiogram from 10:40 AM was reviewed  1. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. The left hemidiaphragm is elevated. There is contrast in the left colon. Monitor leads are in place. A CO2 monitor is in the distal esophagus. 2. Ultrasound confirms pericardial fluid. It appears to be of similar amount to that seen on the CT from several hours earlier. 3. The initial 8 French catheter placed aspirated frank blood. Contrast injection confirmed this to be in the peritoneal cavity. Several 100 mL bloody fluid were aspirated and a sample was sent to the lab. 4. Contrast injection of the second catheter confirms pericardial location. 5. Pericardial fluid returned clear yellow. 6. An 8 French pigtail catheter is adequately positioned and the pericardium. A total of 80 mL clear fluid were aspirated.  Impression:   Critically ill patient who experienced cardiac arrest prior to the visceral arteriography initiation.  An 8 French peritoneal catheter was placed, aspirating bloody fluid.  An 8 French pericardial drain aspirated 80 mL clear yellow fluid.    Technique:  The patient was brought to the IR suite in critical condition.  A left radial art line was in place. Since a radial approach was warranted due to severe thrombocytopenia, the left radial art line was exchanged for a 5 French slender technology sheath. Attention was redirected to placement of an material line on the right for monitoring.  Prior to procedure initiation, the patient experienced cardiac arrest. ROSC was achieved. The patient was responding poorly to resuscitative efforts. Due to the presence of ultrasonographic pericardial fluid and poor left ventricular volume, the decision was made to place a pericardial drain.  The anterior chest wall was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. A 21-gauge needle was advanced toward the pericardial fluid under direct ultrasound guidance. Initially, the wire coursed caudal. The catheter was placed and found to be in the peritoneal cavity. Several 100 mL grossly bloody fluid were aspirated.  From a different window, a longer 21-gauge needle was used to access the pericardial space. Ultrasound images confirmed location. Fluid returned was clear yellow. A 0.018 inch wire was placed. The needle was exchanged for a transitional dilator. The smaller wire was replaced with a short Amplatz wire. Contrast injection confirmed pericardial location. The transitional dilator was exchanged for an 8 French pigtail catheter.  The retention loop of this catheter was formed in the pericardium. 80 mL clear yellow fluid were removed.  The patient was found to be in refractory shock and in spite of blood product administration, pericardial drain placement, and massive pressor support, he could not be successfully resuscitated. The procedure was aborted.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.

Sequence of events so far:  1. [DATE]      Common bile duct access lost during endoscopic stent exchange   2. [DATE]      PTC with 12 French right internal\/external biliary drain placement under GA 3. [DATE]      Biliary drain malpositioned with peritoneal loop. The catheter 12 French was exchanged with moderate sedation 4. [DATE]      A covered stent was placed in the common hepatic and common bile duct under sedation, requiring a large amount of narcotic with poor pain control 5. [DATE]      Today the patient returns for cholangiography for possible drain removal under general anesthesia   PROCEDURE: Catheter cholangiogram and internal\/external drain replacement     FINDINGS: Comparison is made to a prior study dated 12[DATE]. Images from [DATE] and [DATE] were also reviewed..  1.  The scout radiograph shows the internal\/external biliary drain appearing appropriately positioned. There is no leakage at the flank. 2 covered stents are visualized in the extrahepatic bile ducts. 2.  Sheath cholangiogram shows narrowing of the common hepatic duct above the central extent of the stent. The bile ducts are decompressed. 3.  There is extrinsic compression by mass from the left toward the right, narrowing the cephalad portion of the common hepatic duct just beyond the biliary confluence. This is seen as a filling defect with injection at the confluence. 4. The hepatic parenchymal tract is mature. 5. There is ongoing fistulous communication of the mass with the duodenum. 6. The newly placed 12 French right internal\/external biliary drain is appropriately positioned. The cope loop was removed to prevent suture entanglement with the stents should further exchanges be required.   IMPRESSION:  1.  Interval progression of tumor with extrinsic compression of the common hepatic duct near the biliary confluence. 2.  Uneventful image guided replacement of an internal\/external biliary catheter as described. 3. This patient will be catheter dependent from this point forward.   PLAN: 1.  Routine maintenance in 12 weeks. 2.  The patient was asked to go to the emergency room for lower extremity swelling. He declined and states he would rather go to the emergency room near his home in [HOSPITAL].   TECHNIQUE:    The existing catheter and surrounding soft tissues were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.    A 0.035\" glidewire was negotiated through the catheter into the small bowel.  The catheter was removed over the wire and a short 8 French sheath placed. Sheath injection evaluated the biliary tree. Proximal tumor extension was identified with extrinsic compression just beyond the hilum.  A DSA run showed a patent stent with some irregularity and prompt flow into the duodenum. A 5F catheter was placed adjacent to the glide to better delineate the cephalad portion of the common hepatic duct.  A tractogram was performed on sheath withdrawal.  A 12 French internal\/external biliary drain with extended sideholes (no standard catheter available) was modified by removing the retention suture and placed over the wire.  Contrast was injected to confirm tube position.  The tube was capped.  The catheter was secured to the skin with 2-0 Ethilon.

Permanent recording and reporting of the saved image and study into the PACS system was performed. An 0.035\" wire was advanced into the aorta. A vascular sheath was placed over the wire into the common femoral artery. A side flush was started.  A 5-Fr Omni Flush diagnostic catheter was advanced over an 0.035\" wire into the abdominal aorta. Aortogram was performed as detailed above. Next, the Omni Flush was exchanged for a 5 French Mickelson catheter. The catheter was used to catheterize the vessels described above. Angiograms were performed. A 2.8 F Progreat microcatheter system and [VENDOR]ster microwire was used to catheterize distal vessels, as described above. Specific vessels catheterized.  Once the catheter was in adequate position, utilization was performed using Obsidio conformable embolic. Approximately 0.10 ml was introduced into the microcatheter and flushed using contrast to deliver the embolic to the desired location. Postembolization angiography was performed as detailed above.  Next, the Mickelson catheter was exchanged for the Omni Flush catheter. Using a 0.035'' wire the catheter was placed at the iliac bifurcation and used to advance a wire to the contralateral left external iliac artery. The Omni flush catheter was exchanged for a 5 French Cobra C2 glide catheter and advanced into the left external iliac artery. Angiography was performed as detailed above. Once again the microcatheter system was used to subselect vessels as detailed above. The Cobra C2 glide was then used to catheterize the left internal iliac artery. Angiography was performed as detailed above.  Finally, completion aortography was performed which demonstrates cessation of the previously noted active extravasation. No new areas of active extravasation are noted along the left flank.  All catheters and wires were removed from the patient. Hemostasis was achieved using vascular closure device, Angio-Seal.

Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a 5 French Vascade closure device  followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Cerebral angiogram [DATE].  FINDINGS:  LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is evidence of a subtle persistent shunt with arterial supply from the anterior choroidal artery and very slightly early venous drainage into the internal cerebral veins, slightly less conspicuous than prior angiogram. There is no evidence of focal stenosis or aneurysm.  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is very subtle evidence of early filling of the internal cerebral veins by the thalamic perforators arising from the basilar artery. This again appears less conspicuous than on prior angiogram. No aneurysm or focal stenosis was identified. Reflux of contrast into the contralateral vertebral artery was achieved. The origin of PICA is normal bilaterally.   COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: 1.

Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, hemorrhage, renal failure, limb loss, death, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.  After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion after intubation by the anesthesiology team. Access to the vascular system was gained by a single-wall puncture of the right common femoral artery. An angiogram of the right common femoral artery was performed through the outer cannula the dilator in order to ensure appropriate location of the arteriotomy and suitability of the artery for use of closure device. A 6 French short sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery  using Seldinger technique. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously. Using fluoroscopic guidance, the 5 French diagnostic catheter was used to select the bilateral internal carotid arteries and the left vertebral artery.  Digital angiograms were performed of these vessels, centered over the head. Ipsilateral and contralateral oblique projections were obtained of both internal carotid artery injections to evaluate for anterior communicating or MCA bifurcation aneurysms.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the mid cervical segment of the right internal carotid artery for better delineation of the intracranial vasculature. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.  Following the diagnostic angiogram, an aspirin rectal suppository (300 mg) and an additional 2000 units of heparin IV were administered in preparation for coiling. A CTs were checked and additional heparin boluses were administered as needed in order to maintain an ACT between 250 and 300. The 6 French short Terumo sheath was exchanged over a Bentson wire for a 6 French 65 cm arrow long sheath. The diagnostic catheter and Bentson guidewire were advanced through the arrow sheath and used to select the right internal carotid artery. The arrow sheath was advanced into the right common carotid artery. The diagnostic catheter and Bentson guidewire were removed. The Sofia guide catheter was advanced over the Terumo Glidewire through the error sheath, and under roadmap guidance was advanced into the right internal carotid artery just proximal to the tonsillar loop. The Terumo Glidewire was withdrawn.  The balloon was then prepared on an adjacent table, and the microguidewire and the balloon were passed coaxially through the guide catheter into the 6 French Sofia catheter. The microcatheter and microwire and Hyperform balloon were advanced past the cervical into the ascending petrous portion of the right internal carotid artery. The Sofia catheter was advanced over these into the petrous segment of the right ICA. We attempted to advance the Hyperform balloon into the ACA, but was difficult to push and there seemed to be friction with the headway catheter. It was therefore removed and replaced with a scepter xc balloon which was advanced into the right ACA and positioned over the neck of the aneurysm without difficulty. Superselective catheterization of the anterior communicating artery aneurysm performed with the microcatheter over a microguidewire.   The aneurysm was framed and filled with the aforementioned coils using roadmap and blank roadmap technique. After the first several coils were placed within the aneurysm we withdrew the microcatheter from the aneurysm and reaccessed the aneurysm in order to more completely fill the aneurysm. The balloon was left in place in case of aneurysm rupture, but was not inflated during the case.   A final cerebral angiogram was done in the AP and lateral projection to evaluate for residual filling, and distal emboli.  Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Ancef was administered.  Hemostasis was achieved by application of a Perclose ProGlide. A Tegaderm was then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: None.  FINDINGS: RIGHT COMMON FEMORAL ARTERY: The arteriotomy is above the bifurcation of the right common femoral artery and the diameter of the vessel is adequate for a Perclose ProGlide.  RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a saccular aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery, the dimensions of which are described on 3-D rotational angiogram discussed below. No other aneurysms are identified. There is a tortuous tonsillar loop. No focal stenosis or early draining vein are identified.   RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Reflux of contrast into the  left vertebral artery was achieved. The origin of PICA is normal bilaterally.   LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Again there is seen a tortuous tonsillar loop.

To be removed in 2 hours. Left-hand neurovascular checks Q1 hours for 4 hours.  3. Plan to discuss a followup ablation of known renal mass in IR clinic.  TECHNIQUE:  With the patient in the supine position, the left wrist was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. The left wrist was evaluated with ultrasound and appropriate left radial artery access criteria were documented. A modified Allen test (Barbeau test) was performed on the left wrist to confirm patency of the ulnopalmar arch using pulse oximetry (Barbeau B).  1% lidocaine solution was administered for local anesthesia. Access was obtained to the left radial artery using a 21 gauge needle and ultrasound guidance,. Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. Permanent recording and reporting of the saved image and study into the PACS system was performed. A wire was placed through the needle. A hydrophilic Glidesheath was advanced slowly over the wire. 3000 units of heparin, 200 mcg of nitroglycerin and 2.5 mg of verapamil was given through the arterial sheath with slow hemodilution. A side flush was started.   A 5-Fr RAVI MG1 catheter was advanced over an 0.035\" Bentson wire into the aorta. The catheter was used to catheterize the right renal artery as detailed above. Multiple angiograms were performed both from the main renal artery, and subselective interlobar renal arteries. No active extravasation, pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula identified. The right inferior pole segmental artery was then subselectively catheterized using a 2.4 Progreat microcatheter\/[VENDOR]ster microwire combination.   Angiogram was performed from the microcatheter which demonstrated tumor blush. The above embolization was then performed. A postembolization angiogram demonstrated no further flow to the tumor. This same microcatheter\/microwire combination was then used to subselectively catheterize any remaining interlobar arteries, without any abnormality identified.  An upward going capsular branch arising from the main renal artery was then catheterized, and angiogram again demonstrated no active extravasation or abnormality.   All catheters and wires were removed from the patient. A band was placed on the left wrist for hemostasis. The access sheath was removed, and a developing hematoma was noted proximally to the TR band (up on the forearm). An additional large TR band was attempted to be applied over the hematoma, however unsuccessful. Coban wrap was then used to wrap the forearm.

{"ReportID":7490284,"ContentText_DEID":"DIAGNOSTIC CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM, POSSIBLE PREOPERATIVE TUMOR EMBOLIZATION  CLINICAL INDICATION: This is a 31 years Male who developed left eye blurry vision no evidence found to have a large sphenoid wing mass. He is now planned to undergo surgical resection and presents for diagnostic cerebral angiography and possible tumor position.   PROCEDURE: Diagnostic cerebral angiogram, possible preoperative tumor embolization  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 60 minutes.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] and [HCW] were the fellow. [HCW] was the resident.  Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right internal carotid artery Right external carotid artery Left internal carotid artery Left external carotid artery Left vertebral artery Left ascending pharyngeal artery  ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia was administered under the supervision of the attending anesthesiologist. Pre-, intra-, and post-anesthesia monitoring records are available in the chart.  MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Heparin 3000 units IV Protamine 20 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter  Headway 17 advanced straight microcatheter Transend-EX microguidewire Omnipaque-300 contrast material (80 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   After reviewing the angiograms, we identified that the tumor supply was predominantly via the bilateral internal carotid arteries without safe target that would result in a high field embolization. We selectively catheterize the left ascending pharyngeal artery using a headway 17 microcatheter over the transcend microguidewire. We performed an angiogram of the left ascending pharyngeal artery. The left ascending pharyngeal artery supplied a very minor portion of the tumor and it was felt that embolization of this branch would not result in a significant decrease in tumor blush overall. At this point the procedure was concluded.  Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a 5 French Vascade closure device  followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Noninvasive imaging.  FINDINGS: RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. There is a tumor blush present, supplied primarily by the meningohypophyseal trunk of the right internal carotid artery.  RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula. No tumor blush is present.  LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. There is a large hypervascular tumor blush present, centered at the left sphenoid wing, supplied predominantly by the inferolateral trunk of the left internal carotid artery.  LEFT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula. There is a small amount of tumor blush supplied by the ascending pharyngeal artery.  LEFT ASCENDING PHARYNGEAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a small amount of tumor blush supplied by a distal superior pharyngeal branch of the left ascending pharyngeal artery.  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Reflux of contrast into the contralateral vertebral artery was achieved. The origin of PICA is normal bilaterally. No tumor blush is present.  COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: 1. There is a large hypervascular tumor centered at the left sphenoid wing supplied predominantly by the inferolateral trunk of the left internal carotid artery, with additional supply from the meningohypophyseal trunk of the right internal carotid artery and the left ascending pharyngeal artery. No targets for safe and high yield embolization were identified."}

{"ReportID":7490132,"ContentText_DEID":"CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM AND ENDOVASCULAR PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION OF A RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY ANEURYSM  CLINICAL INDICATION: 61-year-old gentleman with a history of tobacco use and an incidentally discovered right vertebral artery aneurysm which was first noted on evaluation for a transient episode of global amnesia. Given the size and location of the aneurysm, as well as the patient's age and health status, treatment is indicated.  PROCEDURE:  1.\tCerebral angiogram  2.\tEndovascular pipeline embolization  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 1.5 hours.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] and [HCW] were the fellows. Each actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS CATHETERIZED: Right vertebral artery  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right radial artery (roadmap) Right subclavian artery Right vertebral artery  VESSELS TREATED (in sequence): Right vertebral artery  ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. Pre-, intra-, and post-anesthesia monitoring records are available in the chart.  MEDICATIONS:  Nitropaste Heparin 5000 units (1000 units IA - right radial artery, 4000 units IV) Nitroglycerin 200 mcg IA (right radial artery) Verapamil 2.5 mg IA (right radial artery)   MATERIALS:  6 French Terumo slender sheath with introducer kit 0.035\" Terumo Glidewire (180 cm) 5 French Sofia guide catheter (115 cm) Phenom 27 microcatheter (150 cm) Asahi 018 microguidewire (200 cm) 6 mm x 20 mm pipeline vantage embolization device TR band Omnipaque-300 contrast (100 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, stent thrombosis\/stenosis, stent migration, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, non-target embolization, puncture site hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite, intubated, and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Ultrasound evaluation of the right radial artery was performed prior to prepping and draping. The radial artery was visualized using ultrasound from the distal wrist to its origin. The radial artery was patent throughout it's course from the wrist with origin from the brachial artery. Prior to prepping a small amount of Nitropaste was applied over the course of the radial artery on the distal wrist. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right radial artery under ultrasound guidance. The introducer wire was visualized within the radial artery using ultrasound. The course of the introducer wire was also visualized using fluoroscopy. Once we were satisfied that the introducer wire was well positioned within the radial and brachial artery, the 6 French Terumo slender sheath was advanced into the right radial artery over the introducer wire. Through the Terumo slender sheath, a roadmap angiogram of the of the right radial artery was obtained to evaluate for radiolucent and to ensure that there are no problems with the access site. A radial \"cocktail\" of 1000 units of heparin, 200 mcg of nitroglycerin, and 2.5 mg of verapamil were administered slowly through the Terumo slender sheath into the right radial artery. An additional 4000 units of heparin were administered IV. ACT checks were performed and additional heparin boluses were administered as needed in order to achieve a ACT of 250-300.  The 5 French Sofia catheter over a Terumo Glidewire were advanced through the radial sheath, and under fluoroscopic guidance were advanced into the proximal subclavian artery. An angiogram of the right subclavian artery was performed ordered to visualize the origin of the right vertebral artery. Using fluoroscopic guidance the vertebral artery was selected using the Terumo Glidewire, and the Sofia catheter was advanced over the Terumo Glidewire into the distal V2 segment of the right vertebral artery. Digital angiograms were performed in the AP and lateral projections centered over the head and neck.   3D rotational angiography was performed with the Sofia catheter in the distal V2 segment of the right vertebral artery to better delineate the intracranial vasculature. The acquisition was processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.   A working projection was obtained to best demonstrate the neck of the right vertebral artery aneurysm, as well as, the distal and proximal landing zones for the stent. Superselective catheterization of the distal vertebral artery was performed with the [VENDOR]om 27 microcatheter over the Asa[VENDOR] 18 microguidewire. The tip of the microguidewire was situated in the distal V4 segment of the right vertebral. The microguidewire in the phenom catheter was then exchanged for a 6 mm x 20 mm pipeline embolization device. The device was deployed under fluoroscopic guidance and a single shot X-ray was performed to confirm that the distal and proximal ends of the pipeline embolization device were in the right vertebral artery, just proximal to the origin of the anterior spinal artery and the V3 segment, respectively. Postprocessing of the pipeline embolization device was not needed.  A final AP and Lateral angiogram were completed to evaluate the distal vasculature for perfusion deficits and emboli.   After completion of the procedure, the sheath was removed and hemostasis obtained using a TR band.  COMPARISON: Angiograms dated [DATE] and [DATE].  FINDINGS:  RIGHT SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY: The origin of the vertebral artery, mammillary artery, and thyrocervical and costocervical trunks are visualized. The aneurysm of the V4 segment of the right vertebral artery is better visualized on the dedicated vertebral artery runs discussed below. Otherwise, the course and caliber of the the visualized portions of these vessels and their branches are normal in course and caliber.  RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: Grossly unchanged right vertebral artery aneurysm which arises just distal to the origin of the PICA. The anterior spinal artery originates from the right vertebral artery distal to the aneurysm.    RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION): There is a small region along the inferior aspect of the midportion of the stent as it crosses over the turn in the vertebral artery that is not quite apposed to the artery. The Pipeline device is otherwise well apposed to the vessel walls throughout it's course. The device does not cover the origin of the anterior spinal artery. Stasis of contrast is noted within the aneurysm. . No perfusion deficits to suggest distal emboli are present.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY: A 3D rotational angiogram of the  right vertebral artery was completed and post-processed on an independent work station. 3D angiography revealed grossly stable wide necked aneurysm of the vertebral artery which originates just distal to and separate from the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. This imaging was obtained primarily for acquisition of appropriate treatment views as well as sizing of device.   COMPLICATIONS: none immediate.  IMPRESSION:  1.\tGrossly stable widening aneurysm of the right vertebral artery which originates just distal to but separate from the PICA. 2.\tSuccessful placement of pipeline vantage embolization device in the right vertebral artery covering the above aneurysm with resulting contrast stagnation within the aneurysm.

Sedation was administered by a specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for the duration of the procedure as outlined above (Total intra service time, 30min ). Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.   MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Versed 1 mg IV Fentanyl 50 mcg IV Heparin 3000 units IV Protamine 20 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter  5 French Simmons 3 Glide catheter  Cardiva Vascade Visipaque-270 contrast material (120 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the right internal carotid artery for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Vascade followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Noninvasive imaging.

She also has a basilar apex aneurysm which is indicated.   PROCEDURE: Cerebral angiogram, Woven Endobridge device embolization of basilar apex aneurysm.  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: 4 hours.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician.  He supervised the entire procedure. [HCW] and [HCW] were the fellows. Each actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS CATHETERIZED: Left vertebral artery Basilar artery  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right subclavian artery Right common femoral artery Left vertebral artery Left subclavian artery  VESSELS TREATED (in sequence): Basilar artery  ANESTHESIA:   General Anesthesia administered by anesthesiology staff.

Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, hemorrhage, renal failure, limb loss, death, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.  After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion after intubation by the anesthesiology team.   Initial access to the vascular system was via the right radial artery. A right radial artery line and replaced by anesthesia staff. Through the pre-existing right radial catheter a guidewire was introduced and the radial artery line catheter was exchanged for a 6 French slender Terumo sheath. A radial cocktail consisting of 2.5 mg of verapamil, 200 mcg of nitroglycerin, and 1000 units of heparin was given slowly via the radial sheath. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the 5 French [VENDOR] Performa vertebral catheter was advanced over the 150 cm baby J Glidewire. A roadmap angiogram of the right subclavian was performed. There is evident from this roadmap angiogram that the V2 segment of the right vertebral artery was significantly more tortuous than head appeared on the CT angiogram. Given this we decided to abandon the approach from the right vertebral artery and therefore the right radial approach in favor of a left vertebral artery approach via femoral access.  Access to the vascular system was gained by a single-wall puncture of the right common femoral artery. An angiogram of the right common femoral artery was performed through the outer cannula the dilator to confirm that the arteriotomy was an appropriate location in adequate for use of appropriate closure device. A 6 French 65cm Arrow sheath was introduced into the descending aortausing Seldinger technique and fluoroscopic guidance.  Using fluoroscopic guidance, the 5 French selection catheter was advanced through the arrow sheath to select the left subclavian artery and left vertebral artery.  The arrow sheath was then advanced over the selection catheter into the left subclavian artery. Digital angiogram was performed, centered over the head.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY: Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the proximal to mid V2 segment of the left vertebral artery for better delineation of the intracranial vasculature. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.  Following the diagnostic angiogram, the 5 French diagnostic catheter was withdrawn.  Through the long sheath, a 6 French Sofia guide catheter was advanced into the left vertebral artery over the VIA 17 microcatheter and Asahi 014 microguid[HCW]. However we were unable to advance the microcatheter and microguidewire beyond the proximal V3 segment for the 072 Navien guide catheter beyond the mid to distal V2 segment due to the tortuosity of the V2 segment of the left vertebral artery. We therefore removed the 6 French Sofia guide catheter and the microcatheters. Were ultimately able to advance and 5 French Sofia guide catheter over a Terumo Glidewire into the proximal V3 segment of the left vertebral artery.   Superselective catheterization of the basilar artery aneurysm was then performed with the VIA 17 microcatheter over a Asahi 014 microguidewire. The WEB SL 7 mm x 4 mm device was then deployed inside of the aneurysm using roadmap and blank roadmap technique.   A final cerebral angiogram was done in the AP and lateral projection to evaluate for residual filling, and distal emboli.  Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine.  An angiogram of the right common femoral artery was obtained to confirm that the arterial puncture was above the bifurcation that the vessels of adequate size to use a 8 French AngioSeal. Ancef was administered.  Hemostasis was achieved by application of a 8 French AngioSeal. A Tegaderm was then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: None.  FINDINGS: RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CERVICAL (ROADMAP): This run was done primarily for navigation and selection of the right vertebral artery and is of limited diagnostic utility. Within those confines, there is severe tortuosity of the V2 segment of the right vertebral artery.  RIGHT COMMON FEMORAL ARTERY: The arteriotomy is above the bifurcation of the right common femoral artery and the diameter of the vessel is adequate for a 6 French AngioSeal.  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CERVICAL (ROADMAP): This run was done primarily for navigation and selection of the left vertebral artery and is of limited diagnostic utility. Within those confines, there is also severe tortuosity of the V2 segment of the right vertebral artery, albeit less than was visualized on the right. Additionally the caliber of the left vertebral artery is significantly larger than that of the right vertebral artery.  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a posteriorly projecting basilar apex aneurysm which is grossly unchanged from prior angiogram, the dimensions of which are described on the 3-D rotational angiography discussed below. There is a surgical clip seen in the expected location of the previously seen superior cerebellar artery aneurysm. No visualized recurrence or residual superior cerebellar artery aneurysm.  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-WOVEN ENDOBRIDGE DEVICE DEPLOYMENT): There is a Web device deployed within the basilar apex aneurysm. There is good apposition to the walls of the aneurysm, especially at the base, without evidence of endoleak. There is significant contrast stagnation within the dome of the aneurysm. The bilateral P1 segments appear patent and fill without delay. There are no perfusion deficits to suggest distal emboli in the posterior circulation.  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CERVICAL: No evidence of dissection post catheterization of the left vertebral artery.  LEFT SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY, CERVICOTHORACIC: No evidence of dissection or stenosis of the origin of the left vertebral artery post catheterization.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  3-D rotational angiography demonstrated posteriorly directed basilar apex aneurysm which measures 5.7 x 6.2 x 5.6 x 2.3 mm (axial by axial by neck-to-dome by neck) which is grossly stable in appearance compared to prior.    IMPRESSION: 1.\tSuccessful deployment of WEB device within unruptured basilar apex aneurysm with maintained patency of the bilateral PCAs. 2.\tNo evidence of recurrence or residual previously ligated superior cerebellar artery aneurysm"}

{"ReportID":7392992,"ContentText_DEID":"Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Female Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL]  ESRC.[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  Breast cancer status post bilateral mastectomy. Patient with recurrent chylous leak. Prior lymphangiogram without thoracic duct leak, no embolization performed. Patient underwent thorascopic thoracic duct ligation, with persistent chylous leak.  PROCEDURE:   1. Lymphangiogram. 2. Accessory thoracic duct embolization. 3. Direct cisterna chyle leak embolization.   FINDINGS:  1. No thoracic duct opacification, in keeping with prior surgical ligation.  2. Access into an accessory thoracic duct, without evidence of leak. Successfully embolized with glue (1:1 glue:Lipiodol, 2 cc).  3. Direct access into leak originating at this cisterna chyle, successfully embolized with glue (1:2 glue:Lipiodol, 3 cc).  IMPRESSION:   Technically successful accessory thoracic duct and cisterna chyle glue embo[HCW].  TREATMENT PLAN:  Monitor chest tube drain output, and follow-up with cardiothoracic surgery.   TECHNIQUE:  With the patient in the supine position, the bilateral groins and wide abdomen was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier.   A scout radiograph demonstrated lipiodol staining in the bilateral groins from prior lymphangiogram.  Ultrasound evaluation of bilateral groins demonstrated very few scant, normal-appearing lymph nodes. A small lymph node in the right groin was accessed using a 25-gauge spinal needle, and lipiodol was injected. Under fluoroscopic visualization, lipiodol was seen transiting up the iliac chain. Evaluation of the left groin without any appropriate lymph node target lipiodol injection.  A lymph node in the left iliac chain was then targeted under direct fluoroscopic guidance and accessed using a 21-gauge Chiba needle. More lipiodol was injected, and transitted up the iliac chain to the abdominal lymph nodes.  Intermittent fluoroscopy demonstrated transit of the lipiodol through the abdominal lymphatic network to cisterna chyle, however no lipiodol was seen transiting up into the chest. The cisterna chyle, was then directly accessed using a 21-gauge Chiba needle under fluoroscopic guidance. Lipiodol injection demonstrated mild lipiodol opacification and transit up into the chest however no dominant intrathoracic lymphatic duct or definite intrathoracic leak could be identified. A V18 wire was able to be navigated into an accessory thoracic duct into the chest. Cone beam CT confirmed positioning of the wire in this duct, without evidence of leak. The thoracic duct (known location from prior lymphangiogram), could not be identified, in keeping with the patient's known history of thoracic duct ligation.  Attention was then turned to the patient's neck, where we attempted to access the venolymphatic junction deep to the left internal jugular vein, however multiple attempts were unsuccessful, and these attempts were aborted.  We then reviewed the images obtained point extensively, that even before early injections of the cisterna chyle, lipiodol appeared to be leaking towards the right upper quadrant\/right lower chest. Cone beam CT was then performed, and lipiodol was confirmed in the right pleural space, indicating that this truly was the site of leak.   The 21-gauge Chiba needle was then used to access a lymph node one vertebral body lower than the cisterna chyle, and glue was injected to this lymph node (with some retrograde flow noted down the abdominal lymphatic chain). The needle was then used to access the confirmed leak near its neck adjacent to the cisterna chyle. More glue was injected, under direct fluoroscopic evaluation, and lipiodol was seen within the chest tube.  At the end of the procedure all needles and wires were removed from the patient's body. The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition without any immediate postprocedural complications.

Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the right internal carotid artery for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Vascade followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: None.  FINDINGS: RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a large right MCA bifurcation aneurysm, better described on the 3-D angiogram below.

MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Versed 1 mg IV Fentanyl 50 mcg IV Heparin 3000 units IV Protamine 20 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter  5 French Vascade closure device Visipaque-270 contrast material (80 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the left internal carotid artery for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a 5 French Vascade closure device  followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Cerebral angiogram [DATE].  FINDINGS: RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. There is mild intracranial atherosclerotic disease at the cavernous and supraclinoid internal carotid artery segments.  RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No new aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. The previously seen medially directed outpouching just proximal to the ophthalmic segment is better seen on the 3-D angiogram below.  LEFT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Reflux of contrast into the contralateral vertebral artery was achieved. The origin of PICA is normal bilaterally.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated a small medially directed outpouching just proximal to the takeoff of the left ophthalmic artery, seen on prior 3-D angiogram and stable in size, likely extradural.  COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: 1. No etiology for patient's previous perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage was identified on this angiogram. 2. There is a small medially directed outpouching of the internal carotid artery just proximal to the ophthalmic artery takeoff, previously thought to represent intracranial atherosclerotic disease, stable from prior. This lesion is also likely extradural.  [HCW], was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance. "}

{"ReportID":7393406,"ContentText_DEID":"Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Male Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL]  [ID]C[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  HCC. Prior treatments with Y90 and microwave ablation. Persistent nodular residual disease on most recent MRI.  PROCEDURE:   1. US-guided right femoral artery access. 2. Diagnostic visceral angiography. 3. Transarterial chemoembolization segment 7 and segment 8 branches. 4. Transarterial bland embolization of the right phrenic artery. 5. Right common femoral artery angiogram and closure.  Cone-beam CT performed for intraprocedural localization, as detailed below.  FINDINGS: ANGIOGRAPHY: Vessels catheterized and angiograms performed, as follows:  Celiac artery: Conventional anatomy. Right hepatic artery: Extensive tumoral blush identified.  Posterior branch right hepatic artery: Tumoral blush identified. Anterior branch right hepatic artery: Tumoral blush identified.  Right phrenic artery: Vascular supply to the region of the previously treated tumor, without definite tumor blush.  Specific technical notes \/ catheter selection: 5 French sheath SOS2 catheter 2.4 Progreat microcatheter Fathom microwire  CBCT: Yes Catheter location: Right hepatic artery Findings: Tumoral blush identified with supply from the multiple branches of the anterior and posterior division.   Transcatheter embolization:  Tumor location: Segment 7\/8  Embolic 1: Conventional TACE (50 mg doxorubicin in 5 mL contrast mixed 1:1 with lipiodol) for 10 mL total solution. Embolic 2: 2 vials 100-300 Embospheres  Phrenic artery embolization: Additional bland embolization of the right phrenic artery to substasis with 100-300 um embospheres.  IMPRESSION:   1. MAA shunt study aborted due to unfavorable multivascular supply to the tumor.  2. Successful conventional-TACE treatment of the segment 7\/8 hepatocellular carcinoma.  3. Additional bland embolization to the right phrenic artery.  TREATMENT PLAN:  1. [HCW]t will return to clinic in 6-8 weeks with abdominal MRI and labs.  2. Access site precautions and orders placed.  TECHNIQUE:  With the patient in the supine position, the groin was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. The patient was placed on the table in a supine position. Following standard prepping and draping, the common femoral artery was punctured using a needle, and an .035 Bentson wire was advanced into the aorta. A 5-French vascular sheath was placed over the wire into the common femoral artery. A side flush was started.  A 5-Fr SOS2 catheter was advanced over an 0.035\" Bentson wire into the abdominal aorta. The catheter was used to catheterize the celiac artery. Angiograms and cone beam CT were performed and demonstrated multifocal vascular supply to the large segment 7\/8 tumor, rendering the patient in unfavorable candidate. Additionally, cone beam CT showed favorable response to conventional chemotherapy performed along the superior margins of the tumor.   After conversation with the patient and his family, the decision was made to abandon MAA shunt study and pursue conventional TACE treatment. Consent was obtained from the patient's daughter, and doxorubicin was ordered from the pharmacy.  The above microwire\/microcatheter system was used to catheterize distal the anterior and posterior divisions of the right hepatic artery, and chemoembolization was performed as detailed above. Follow-up contrasted and noncontrasted cone beam CTs confirmed successful treatment of the viable tumor, with minimal embolization of the normal hepatic parenchyma.  Attention was then turned to the phrenic artery, which previously demonstrated vascular supply to the superior aspects of the tumor. Phrenic artery was catheterized using a Mickelson. Repeat angiography today demonstrated vascular supply approaching the tumor, without definite tumoral blush. The decision was made to treat with bland embolization as detailed above.   A right common femoral artery angiogram was performed, demonstrating appropriate vascular access above the profunda femoris artery bifurcation. All catheters and wires were removed from the patient. Hemostasis was achieved using Perclose vascular closure device. The site was dressed in usual fashion.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition without any immediate postprocedural complications.

She is also noted to have unruptured right pericallosal artery aneurysm and superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm. She made a remarkable recovery following her subarachnoid hemorrhage. Given her young age, good health, and history of ruptured aneurysm, treatment of her other aneurysms was indicated. She underwent craniotomy and clip ligation of the pericallosal aneurysm [DATE] this past year. She returns today for pipeline embolization of the right superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm.  PROCEDURE:  1.\tCerebral angiogram  2.\tEndovascular pipeline embolization   DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 2 hours.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] was the fellow. [HCW], PhD was the resident. Each actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.

Pre-, intra-, and post-anesthesia monitoring records are available in the chart.  MEDICATIONS:  Heparin 5000 units IV Ancef 2 grams IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 8 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 0.035\" Bentson Guidewire 0.035\" Terumo Glidewire (180 cm) 6 French 65 cm arrow  5 French Merit Performa Vertebral catheter 058 Navien guide catheter (115 cm) Phenom 27 microcatheter (150 cm) Asahi 018 microguidewire (200 cm) 3.25 mm x 12 mm pipeline embolization device 6 French Angio-Seal closure device Omnipaque-300 contrast (120 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, stent thrombosis\/stenosis, stent migration, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, non-target embolization, puncture site hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite, intubated, and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery. Through the dilator sheath, an angiogram of the of the right common femoral artery was obtained to ensure the arteriotomy was above the level of the bifurcation and the CFA was of sufficient size to use the 6 French Angio-Seal closure device. 6 French 65 cm arrow sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery, and under fluoroscopic guidance was advanced into the proximal descending aorta over the Bentson wire. 5000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement; additional boluses of heparin were administered at one-hour intervals. The ACT was checked to ensure that it was between 250-300.   The diagnostic catheter was used to select the right carotid artery. A roadmap angiogram right carotid artery was performed. The diagnostic catheter was advanced over the Terumo Glidewire into the right internal carotid artery. The arrow sheath was advanced over the diagnostic catheter into the right common carotid artery. Digital angiograms were performed centered over the head in the AP and lateral projections.  3D rotational angiography was performed with the selection catheter in the mid cervical segment of the right internal carotid artery to better delineate the right superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm and anatomy of the right intracranial ICA. The acquisition was processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.   The diagnostic catheter was removed from the arrow sheath and the 058 Navien guide catheter was advanced over the Terumo Glidewire into the distal cervical segment of the right internal carotid artery using roadmap angiogram fluoroscopic guidance. The Glidewire was withdrawn.   A working projection was obtained to best demonstrate the neck of the superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm, as well as, the distal and proximal landing zones for the stent. Superselective catheterization of the right middle cerebral artery was performed with the Phenom 27 microcatheter over the Asahi 18 microguidewire. The tip of the microguidewire was situated in the distal M1\/proximal M2 of the right MCA. The microguidewire in the pipeline catheter was then exchanged for a 3.25 mm x 12 mm pipeline embolization device. The device was deployed under fluoroscopic guidance and a single shot X-ray was performed to confirm that the distal and proximal ends of the pipeline embolization device were in the right ICA communicating segment and right ICA cavernous segment, respectively. There was good apposition of the device along its entire course and therefore postprocessing of the pipeline embolization device was not required.  A final AP and Lateral angiogram were completed to evaluate the distal vasculature for perfusion deficits and emboli.   Using fluoroscopic guidance,  the additional arteries  listed above were selectively catheterized. Digital angiograms were performed in the AP and lateral projections centered over the head and neck.   After completion of the procedure, the sheath was removed and hemostasis obtained using the 6 French Angio-Seal closure device. A Tegaderm were then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: Diagnostic cerebral angiogram from outside institution from [DATE] of this past year.  FINDINGS: RIGHT COMMON FEMORAL ARTERY: Mild focal spasm of the proximal deep femoral artery related to access. The arteriotomy was above the level of the bifurcation and the CFA was of sufficient size to use the 6 French Angio-Seal closure device.   RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  There is a medially directed superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm, the dimensions of which are described on the 3-D angiography discussed below. Measurements of the ICA diameter were taken in very from 3.2 mm in the distal ophthalmic\/proximal communicating segment to 2.8 mm in the cavernous segment. There is mild catheterization related vasospasm of the distal cervical ICA. The right middle meningeal artery originates from the distal cervical ICA.  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION): The Pipeline device is well apposed to the vessel walls throughout it's course without endoleak. . Stasis of contrast is noted within the aneurysm. . Once again there is noted to be mild to moderate catheter related spasm of the right ICA without flow limitation. No perfusion deficits to suggest distal emboli are present.  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a WEB device seen in the expected location. There is no filling of the previously seen basilar apex aneurysm. Reflux of contrast into the  contralateral vertebral artery was achieved. The origin of PICA is normal bilaterally.   LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There are aneurysm clips seen in the expected location. There is no evidence of ongoing filling from the previously treated pericallosal aneurysm. No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified.     3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY: A 3D rotational angiogram of the  right internal carotid artery was completed and post-processed on an independent work station. 3D angiography revealed a superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm which measures 3.0 x 2.8 x 2.6 x 2.3 mm (axial by axial by neck-to-dome by neck). The internal carotid artery from the distal ophthalmic segment to the mid cavernous segment measures from 3.1 to 3.4 mm in diameter.    COMPLICATIONS: none immediate.

OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] was the fellow.   VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: None  ANESTHESIA: Local in the right groin with bupivacaine. Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by the nurse present during the entire procedure. The patient returned to baseline mental status prior to trans[HCW] from the department. Sedation was administered by a specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for the duration of the procedure as outlined above (Total intra service time, 30 min ). Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 25 cc  Fentanyl 25 mcg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 5 French Simmons 3 Glide catheter   TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. We attempted to gain access to the right common femoral artery using ultrasound but were unable to despite several attempts. We did cannulate the common femoral vein using the microcatheter dilator, then removed the microcatheter dilator and held manual pressure for 10 minutes until adequate hemostasis was achieved. We then discussed with the patient different options done to proceed. Given the result of the aneurysm coiling during her treatment angiogram, we recommended that the patient first obtained an MRA time-of-flight time resolved. If that MRA were to show concern for recurrence, we could bring the patient back on a different date and attempt a transradial approach. The patient was agreeable to this plan and we aborted the procedure.  COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: 1. Aborted diagnostic cerebral angiogram due to difficulty obtaining access into the right common femoral artery which was limited by body habitus. Plan to obtain MRA time-of-flight time resolved in the meantime and consider a radial approach in the future.  [HCW], was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance. "}

PROCEDURE:  1.\tCerebral angiogram  2.\tEndovascular pipeline embolization  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 2 hours.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] was the fellow. Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS CATHETERIZED: Right vertebral artery Right posterior inferior cerebellar artery  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right vertebral artery  VESSELS TREATED (in sequence): Right PICA  ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. Pre-, intra-, and post-anesthesia monitoring records are available in the chart.  MEDICATIONS:  Nitropaste Heparin 5500 units (1000 units intra-arterial into the right radial artery, and 4500 units IV) Nitroglycerin 200 mcg IA into the right radial artery Verapamil 2.5 mg IA into the right radial artery   MATERIALS:  6 French Terumo slender sheath, long (25 cm) 0.035\" Terumo Glidewire (180 cm) 5 French Sofia guide catheter (115 cm) 058 Navien guide catheter (105 cm) Phenom 21 microcatheter (150 cm) Asahi 014 microguidewire Transcend-EX microguidewire  Traxcess microguidewire  Aristotle 18 microguidewire (200 cm) 2.5 mm x extending mm pipeline vantage embolization device TR band Omnipaque-300 contrast (120 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, stent thrombosis\/stenosis, stent migration, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, non-target embolization, puncture site hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite, intubated, and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A small amount of Nitropaste was placed over the distal radial artery at the wrist. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right radial artery. A long (25 cm) 6 French Terumo slender sheath was introduced into the right radial artery. A radial cocktail of 1000 units of heparin, 200 mcg of nitroglycerin, and 2.5 mg of verapamil was administered intra-arterially into the right radial artery via the sheath. An additional 4000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. A CTs were monitored and additional heparin boluses were given as necessary to maintain an ACT between 250-300  Using fluoroscopic and roadmap guidance, a 5 French Sofia guide catheter was advanced over the Terumo Glidewire into the distal V2 segment of the right vertebral artery. The Terumo Glidewire was removed and the phenom 21 was advanced through the Sofia catheter over the 014 Asahi microguidewire. As we attempted to maneuver the microguidewire and microcatheter around the V3 segment of the right vertebral artery the Sofia catheter continually herniated into the subclavian artery. After several attempts of advancing the system more distally we decided to abandon the Sofia guide catheter in favor of an 058 Navien. Using fluoroscopic and roadmap guidance were able to readily advance the 058 Navien catheter into the distal V3 segment of the right vertebral artery over the Terumo Glidewire. Digital angiograms were performed in the AP and lateral projections centered over the head and neck.   Using the 3-D rotational angiogram in the day prior, we were able to able to select appropriate working projections for placement of the pipeline embolization device.  There phenom 21 microcatheter and Asahi 014 microguidewire were advanced coaxially through the 058 Navien catheter. There was noted that it was difficult to report the microguidewire. However with reshaping microguidewire we were able to advance the microguidewire into the proximal PICA followed by the microcatheter. However despite multiple attempts in the shaping the wire were unable to navigate the wire passed the aneurysm. We tried multiple different shapes and different microguidewire as (as listed above). Ultimately we were able to navigate beyond the aneurysm using a steam-shaped phenom 21 microcatheter as well as and Aristotle 18 microguidewire.  The microguidewire in the phenom catheter was then exchanged for a 2.5 mm x 16 mm pipeline embolization device. The device was deployed under fluoroscopic guidance and a single shot X-ray was performed to confirm that the distal and proximal ends of the pipeline embolization device were opened appropriately, that the device was well apposed to the artery, covered the aneurysm, and that the proximal end of the device remain within the PICA.. Postprocessing of the pipeline embolization device not needed.  A final AP and Lateral angiogram were completed to evaluate the distal vasculature for perfusion deficits and emboli.   After completion of the procedure, the sheath was removed and hemostasis obtained using the TR band.   COMPARISON: Diagnostic angiogram dated [DATE].

PROCEDURE:   1.\tUS-guided right and left common femoral artery access. (Left access obtained for intraprocedural monitoring overseen by Anesthesia). 2.\tVisceral angiography 3.\tArterial embolization 4.\tPost-embolization angiography 5.\tBilateral common femoral artery angiogram and closure  FINDINGS:  1.\tPatent and compressible left and right common femoral arteries on preliminary US. 2.\tAortography was performed in the sagittal plane at end-inspiration and end-expiration with occlusion of the proximal celiac artery demonstrated in both phases. Dynamic arteriography is therefore unable to establish or rule out underlying median arcuate ligament phenomenon. 3.\tUnable to traverse the celiac artery occlusion. Attempts were abandoned after SMA angiography demonstrated very early filling of the target aneurysm indicating an origin near the proximal SMA. Rich pancreaticoduodenal arterial system with brisk filling of the hepatic and splenic arteries via this supply noted. 4.\tSuccessful catheterization of the aneurysm sac directly from the SMA trunk and demonstration of isolated outflow through the dorsal pancreatic artery on contrast injection. No inflow vessel or aneurysm neck of significant length observed. 5.\tCoil embolization of the dorsal pancreatic artery with complete hemostasis on post-embolization angiogram. 6.\tCoil embolization of the aneurysm sac with post-embolization angiogram demonstrating persistent occlusion of the dorsal pancreatic artery outflow, delayed opacification of tiny perforating branches near the sac which were not amenable to further treatment. Of note, the sac was successfully embolized to its juncture with the SMA trunk. Patency of the SMA and its branches also visualized. 7.\tLimited angiography of the bilateral common femoral arteries demonstrated expected access above the femoral bifurcations.  ANGIOGRAPHY: Vessels catheterized using base catheter and microcatheter\/microwire combination and angiograms performed:  Celiac artery: Likely chronic occlusion. Delayed opacification of the hepatic and splenic arteries from retrograde\/collateral flow from a prominent pancreaticoduodenal system. Occlusion of the proximal celiac artery persists on end-inspiration and end-expiration aortography.  Superior mesenteric artery: Very early filling of a splanchnic aneurysm with angiography in multiple views demonstrating an origin posterolateral to the SMA trunk. The sac was ultimately successfully accessed utilizing an Ansel 2 sheath, Rim catheter, 2.4F ProGreat, and double angle GT microwire. Isolated outflow through the dorsal pancreatic artery on contrast injection. No inflow vessel or aneurysm neck of significant length observed.  Post-embolization angiography of the aneurysm sac: Reflux of contrast out of the aneurysm sac into the proximal superior mesenteric artery. Persistent hemostasis of the treated dorsal pancreatic artery.  Postembolization superior mesenteric artery angiography: No opacification of the aneurysm sac with preservation of flow into the inferior pancreaticoduodenal, middle colic and remainder of superior mesenteric artery branches.

The dorsal pancreatic artery and aneurysm sac were embolized to complete hemostasis. 2.\tProximal celiac artery occlusion present on both end-inspiration and end-expiration aortography. Median arcuate ligament phenomenon could not be definitely established or ruled out with this test.  TREATMENT PLAN:  1.\tAdmission to internal medicine for overnight observation. Coordination of care appreciated greatly. 2.\tStrict bed rest with both legs straight for 3 hours. Bilateral lower extremity neurovascular checks q1h for 3 hours post-procedure. 3.\tChemistry, lipase, and CBC labs in the morning. 4.\tIR clinic in one month with CTA of the abdomen\/pelvis. 5.\tReferral to surgery for consideration of possible MALS.  TECHNIQUE: With the patient in the supine position, the bilateral groins was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. Following standard prepping and draping, the left common femoral artery was punctured using a needle under real-time ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance. A 5 French vascular sheath was placed within the left common femoral artery which was utilized by Anesthesia for intraprocedural monitoring. Following standard prepping and draping, the right common femoral artery was punctured using a needle. Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. Permanent recording and reporting of the saved image and study into the PACS system was performed. An 0.035\" wire was advanced into the aorta. A 6 French vascular sheath was placed over the wire into the common femoral artery. A side flush was initiated with slow continuous infusion of heparinized saline.  A 5-Fr SOS 2 diagnostic catheter was advanced over an 0.035\" wire into the abdominal aorta. The catheter was gently advanced into a proximal celiac artery stump. The distal celiac artery and its branches could not be opacified directly on injection of contrast and a wire could not be passed distally. Aortography was performed using the injector which demonstrated findings related to a chronic celiac axis occlusion as detailed above. Next, angiography was performed of the celiac axis from a lateral projection during end inspiration and end expiration with findings as detailed above.  Next, the SOS 2 diagnostic catheter was used to select the superior mesenteric artery, angiography was performed in multiple views as detailed above. Next a 2.4 F ProGreat microcatheter was used utilizing multiple microwires to navigate into the aneurysm sac which was unsuccessful. The microwire was advanced into the middle colic artery and angiography performed as detailed above.   Over the wire, the existing short 6 French vascular sheath was exchanged for a long 6 French 45 cm Ansel 2 curved sheath. The sheath was advanced into the proximal superior mesenteric artery. Through this a 5 French rim catheter was advanced into the SMA trunk. A 2.4 F progreat microcatheter and double angle GT microwire were then used to access the aneurysm situated posterolateral to the SMA trunk. Angiography was performed. The microcatheter was used to select the dorsal pancreatic artery. Coil embolization was performed as detailed above. Outflow vessel access was lost before further embolization could be performed. Access could not be reestablished but angiography demonstrated that the outflow system was thrombosed. The aneurysm sac was treated utilizing several coils of varying sizes as detailed above. Coil embolization was performed right up until the microcatheter recoiled directly into the proximal superior mesenteric artery.  Post-embolization angiography was performed, as detailed above.  Right and left common femoral artery angiograms were performed, demonstrating appropriate vascular access above the profunda femoris artery bifurcation. All catheters and wires were removed from the patient. Hemostasis was achieved using vascular closure device Angio-Seal bilaterally. The site was dressed in usual fashion.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition without any immediate postprocedural complications.

Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Vascade followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: CTA dated [DATE] and [DATE].  FINDINGS:  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: The left ACA fills and the left MCA partially fills via flow across the anterior communicating artery (due to severe stenosis of the left ICA terminus and hypoplastic left ACA, as seen on left ICA injection discussed below). There is a questionable short segment caliber enlargement of one of the callosomarginal branches which is only visualized in the lateral projection. This may be artifactual or reactive in nature, less likely evidence of RCVS.  No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified.    RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is severe stenosis of the distal ICA and proximal MCA related to intracranial atherosclerotic disease. There is no visualized left A1 segment. There is significant reflux into the ECA (related to the distal ICA stenosis and additional stenosis in the cervical ICA secondary to FMD, as seen on left common carotid injection discussed below)  No aneurysm or early draining vein are identified.    LEFT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY, CERVICAL: There is stenosis and irregularity of the proximal mid cervical segment of the ICA which is most consistent with fibromuscular dysplasia changes. There is a tonsillar loop just distal to the FMD changes. Mild irregularity of the proximal ICA and ECA, most likely related to atherosclerotic changes.  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is partial filling of the left MCA territory via pial collaterals from the left PCA. No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Reflux of contrast into the contralateral vertebral artery was not achieved. The origin of PICA is normal unilaterally (we will defer to CTA for evaluation of the contralateral PICA).    COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.   IMPRESSION:  1. There is severe stenosis of the distal left ICA and proximal left MCA related to intracranial atherosclerotic disease. 2. There is a questionable short segment caliber enlargement of one of the callosomarginal branches which is only visualized in the lateral projection. This may be artifactual or reactive in nature, less likely evidence of RCVS. 3. No visualized aneurysms or arteriovenous shunting lesions which would explain hemorrhage. 4.

A preprocedural pause was performed.  The left upper treatment he was examined with ultrasound, and the left brachial vein was identified to be compressible and patent ultrasound. The left basilic vein was not identifiable as compressible and patent. The skin was marked over accessible portion of the left brachial vein. The site was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. A sterile barrier was created. Under real-time sonography guidance, the skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the left brachial vein were locally anesthetized with 1% Xylocaine. Under real-time ultrasound guidance, left brachial vein was accessed with a 21-gauge needle. A guidewire was advanced into the central veins but could not be advanced into the superior vena cava under fluoroscopy. The needle was removed, and a 5 French micropuncture graduated dilator was advanced over the guidewire into the brachial vein. The wire was removed, and digital subtraction central left subclavian venography was performed. Venographic images of the left upper extremity from the central veins to the percutaneous access site was also performed with digital subtraction venography.  Based on the findings, the 5 French micropuncture dilator was removed, and manual hemostasis was obtained.  Attention was then paid to the right groin, an ultrasound examination demonstrated a compressible and patent right common femoral vein. The skin overlying the common femoral vein was marked with indelible pen. The site was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. A sterile barrier was created. Local anesthesia was infiltrated into the skin and subcutaneous tissues over the common femoral vein. A 4 cm subcutaneous tunnel was then created from the skin overlying the vein to a site inferolateral to the aforementioned site on the right anterolateral thigh. The distance from the venous access site to the level of the right third lumbar pedicle was measured on a guidewire, in this distance was used to custom cut to length of a 5 French single lumen PICC. The distance from the catheter hub to the tip of the catheter was 34 cm. The catheter was then pulled through the subcutaneous tunnel to venous access site and advanced through the peel-away sheath into the common femoral vein and inferior vena cava. The peel-away sheath was removed, fluoroscopic observation of the path of the catheter was evaluated for kinks in the catheter, and the catheter was aspirated and flushed was saline to confirm adequate function. A fluoroscopic spot image was obtained over the abdomen, located catheter tip at the level of the superior endplate of L3. Catheter was secured to the skin with 3-0 Prolene suture, dressing was applied.  Incidentally, there appear to be 6 lumbar vertebral bodies with probable lumbarization of S1.  FINDINGS: Left upper extremity venography demonstrates a patent paired brachial vein with small axillary vein, occlusion of left subclavian and brachiocephalic veins, with somewhat well-developed collaterals from the junction of the left internal jugular and subclavian veins into the azygos vein and superior vena cava. No contrast flows directly through the subclavian and brachiocephalic veins in the superior vena cava. There are paravertebral collaterals noted.  CONCLUSION: 1.

Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, spinal cord infarction, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, hemorrhage, nontargeted embolization, necrosis of skin or mucus membranes, renal failure, limb loss, death, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite, intubated, and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the Right femoral artery; a 5 French Terum[VENDOR] Pinnacle sheath was introduced into the Right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was completed of the above vessels. ACTs were checked periodically and additional heparin was administered to achieve a target of >250. Digital angiograms were performed centered over the head and face. We first evaluated the right internal carotid artery and right external carotid artery, which showed that the right middle meningeal artery was still occluded in both the frontal and parietal branches. We then turned our attention to the left side. An angiogram of the left external carotid artery showed that a prominent branch of the frontal branch of the left middle meningeal artery was crossing midline to the contralateral side. This became our target for embolization.  Superselective catheterization of the left middle meningeal artery was then performed with the [VENDOR]sior 1018 microcatheter and [VENDOR] microguidewire. Contour PVA particles were prepared on an adjacent table and maintained in isobaric suspension with appropriate quantities of saline and contrast and injected into the prominent branch arising from the frontal branch of the left middle meningeal artery using a pulse-spray technique over several minutes. Control angiograms of this vessel were performed before, during, and after the embolization.   Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Cardiva Vascade followed by manual compression. A Tegaderm was then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: noninvasive imaging.  FINDINGS:   RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is mild to moderate narrowing of the terminal internal carotid artery.

OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] was the fellow. Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right internal carotid artery Right external carotid artery  ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia  MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Heparin 5000 units IV Protamine 20 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.035\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Boston Scientific sheath 5 French Cordis vert catheter  Mynx Closure Device Visipaque contrast material (60 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 5000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views. We closely evaluated the right middle meningeal artery and identified the frontal branch supplying the area of the subdural hematoma. Unfortunately this frontal branch was too small in caliber to catheterize safely. This point we concluded the procedure.  Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Mynx closure device followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: None.  FINDINGS: RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Of note the choroidal blush is observed. There is evidence of mass effect from the subdural hematoma.   RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula. The frontal branch of the right middle meningeal artery appears very small in caliber.   COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: 1. There is a very small caliber of the frontal branch of the right middle meningeal artery, precluding MMA embolization. No intervention was pursued.

She underwent external biliary drain placement on [DATE] and returns today for internalization.   PROCEDURES: 1. Catheter Cholangiogram 2. Internal\/External Biliary Drainage Catheter Placement via a new puncture 3. External biliary drainage catheter replacement  FINDINGS: Abdominal MRI with MRCP from [DATE] was reviewed along with the placement images from [DATE]  1. Catheter cholangiogram shows moderate dilation of the central intrahepatic bile ducts.  2. There is a high-grade obstruction of the biliary tree at the hilum. The left and right ducts communicate but the common hepatic duct is not visualized. 3. The accessed duct is segment IVB  with unfavorable vectors for internalization. 4. A new access was created from a segment VI duct. 5. The previous catheter was replaced as the tract is not mature. 6. Successful placement of 10.2 French internal\/external biliary drain via a peripheral segment VI right hepatic duct. 7. The distal common bile duct and ampulla are normal.   IMPRESSION:  TREATMENT PLAN:  The internal-external biliary drainage catheter should remain to gravity drainage. It will be capped as the bilirubin trends down.  The more cephalad catheter can be capped.   PROCEDURE:  The anterior abdominal wall and existing biliary drainage catheter were prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  The existing drain was removed over wire and a short 8 French sheath placed. A long 6 French sheath was placed coaxially and used in combination with multiple catheters (5 French angled catheter, C2 glide catheter, and modified Omni Flush catheter) in combination with a Glidewire in attempts to traverse the high-grade obstruction at the hilum. Vectors were unfavorable. A long 6 French sheath was placed from the accessed duct into the left biliary tree and attention redirected to a new access.  An appropriate skin entry site was identified targeting the opacified segment VI bile duct more caudally. Local anesthetic was injected. In a single pass, the bile duct was punctured with a 22-gauge Chiba needle. A 0.018\" wire was passed, and the needle exchanged for a 6 French transitional dilator.  The inner stiffener, dilator, and guidewire were removed and contrast was injected to confirm location.  A 0.035\" glidewire and 4 French catheter were negotiated across hilar obstruction into the small bowel. The glidewire was removed and contrast was injected to confirm location.  A 0.035\" Amplatz wire was placed through the catheter.  A long 6 French sheath was placed over the Amplatz and a pullback sheath cholangiogram performed to assess the distal CBD. A  10.2 French internal-external biliary drain with extended sideholes was placed over the wire. The Cope loop was formed and locked in the duodenum. The side holes were positioned above the level of obstruction. Contrast was injected to confirm location. The catheter was secured to the skin with 2-0 Ethilon and attached to gravity drainage.  A sterile dressing was applied.  The 6 French sheath was removed over an Amplatz wire and a 10.2 French internal\/external biliary drain was placed over the wire to be used as an external biliary drain (no APDL available).

Superior mesenteric artery stenting 4. Post stenting angiography 5. Right common femoral artery angiogram and closure  FINDINGS: ANGIOGRAPHY: Vessels catheterized using base catheter and microcatheter\/microwire combination and angiograms performed:   Aortogram: Severe narrowing and proximal celiac artery. Superior narrowing of the superior mesenteric artery near its origin.  Superior mesenteric artery: Transcatheter stenting: Details (type\/size\/volume\/number):  Gore VBX 7 mm x 2.9 cm balloon expandable covered stent  IMPRESSION:   Technically successful stenting of the superior mesenteric artery origin.  TREATMENT PLAN:  1. Continued clinical and laboratory monitoring recommended. Please contact interventional radiology if there is a change in clinical status. 2. Routine post-angiography groin cares ordered. 3. Start aspirin 81 mg daily. 4. Follow-up in interventional radiology clinic in 1 month. Follow-up CT angiogram of the abdomen and pelvis in 3 months.  TECHNIQUE: With the patient in the supine position, the groin was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. Following standard prepping and draping, the right common femoral artery was punctured using a needle. Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. Permanent recording and reporting of the saved image and study into the PACS system was performed. An 0.035\" Bentson wire was advanced into the aorta. A 7 French Ansel vascular sheath was placed over the wire into the common femoral artery. A side flush was started.  A 5-Fr Omni Flush catheter was advanced over the Bentson wire into the abdominal aorta. An initial aortogram was performed to delineate the visceral anatomy. With the superior mesenteric artery identified; the Omni Flush was exchanged for a SOS2 catheter. This catheter was used to select the origin of the superior mesenteric artery. A Glidewire was advanced distally down the SMA, however the SOS2 catheter would not track over the wire. This catheter was then exchanged for a Cobra C2 glide, which was seated in the mid SMA, beyond the stenosis. The Glidewire was removed, and a Rosen was attempted to be advanced however unfortunately was too stiff, and access into the SMA was lost.  The above process was then repeated to select the superior mesenteric artery, however this time instead of a Cobra C2 glide catheter, a Navicross catheter was and advanced to the distal SMA, and the Rosen was able to be advanced into the distal SMA. The Navicross catheter was removed, the Ansel sheath was advanced, and the above VBX stent was loaded through the sheath and positioned appropriately based on the above angiograms. Once in appropriate position, the stent was deployed, without any complication. It was ballooned up to 8 mm (PowerFlex 8 mm x 4 cm balloon), and flow was significantly improved to the distal SMA. Special attention was made to the early branches off the SMA, none of which were covered by our stent.  A right common femoral artery angiogram was performed, demonstrating appropriate vascular access above the profunda femoris artery bifurcation. All catheters and wires were removed from the patient. Hemostasis was achieved using an Angio-Seal vascular closure device. The site was dressed in usual fashion.

Intrahepatic metastasis producing left bile duct obstruction.  Procedure:   1.\tPullback sheath cholangiogram through existing percutaneous access 2.\tLeft internal\/external biliary drain exchange  Findings:   1.\tSheath cholangiogram demonstrates a portobiliary fistula in the periphery of the left hepatic lobe. The distance from this fistula to the main biliary ductal confluence was measured to be 4.6 cm. 2.\tDecision was made to not place an uncovered stent across the patient's left biliary stricture due to an unacceptable likelihood of involving the fistula. Of note, the left biliary stricture did not appear as severe compared to the previous exam, possibly an effect of interval biliary drain placement. 3.\tNewly placed 10.2 French left biliary drain with extended sideholes is appropriately positioned with the distal tip in the third portion of the duodenum and the proximal side hole peripheral to the stenosis but central to the portobiliary fistula.  Impression:   1.\tPortobiliary fistula in the peripheral left hepatic lobe. 2.\tDecision made to not proceed with initial plan of stenting across the left biliary stricture as detailed above. 3.\tReplacement of 10.2F internal-external biliary catheter to continue drainage and exclude the portobiliary fistula.  Treatment Plan:  1. Initiate capping trial tomorrow.  2. Repeat cholangiogram in 2-4 weeks to assess for healing of portobiliary fistula. If resolved, would look to place stent at that time.  Technique:   The existing catheter and surrounding soft tissues were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.   The existing tube was initially injected, and determined to be patent. An 0.035\" Amplatz wire was negotiated through the catheter into the small bowel. The catheter was removed and exchanged for an 8 French sheath. A pull back sheath cholangiogram was performed which demonstrated the above findings of sizable left to left portobiliary fistula.  A repeat sheath cholangiogram was performed in the RAO projection, and measurements were taken to assess the length of the stricture. It was determined that the risk of stent placement outweighs the potential benefit at this time.  The sheath was removed and a new 10.2 French internal\/external biliary drain with extended sideholes was placed over the wire. Contrast was injected to confirm tube position. The catheter was secured to the skin with 2-0 Ethilon. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.

Technique:  With the patient in the supine position, the left wrist and bilateral groins were prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. The left wrist was evaluated with ultrasound and left radial artery patency and acceptable size criteria were documented. Images were properly stored in PACS. A modified Allen test (Barbeau test C) was performed on the left wrist to confirm patency of the ulnopalmar arch using pulse oximetry.   1% lidocaine solution was administered for local anesthesia. Access was obtained to the left radial artery using a 21 gauge micro needle and ultrasound guidance. Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. Permanent recording and reporting of the saved image and study into the PACS system was performed. A wire was placed through the needle. A hydrophilic Glidesheath was advanced slowly over the wire. 3000 units of heparin, 200 mcg of nitroglycerin and 2.5 mg of verapamil was given through the arterial sheath with slow hemodilution. A side flush was started. Hypogastric nerve block, if utilized, is detailed above.  Diagnostic catheter and microcatheter were advanced through the sheath into the aorta and used to catheterize the bilateral internal iliac arteries and pelvic vessels described above. Angiograms were performed. Specific vessels catheterized and embolized are described in detail above. Post-embolization angiography was performed and described above. After completion of left-sided angiography and embolization, the patient began to experience left hand symptoms as above. The decision was made to remove all devices from the left wrist. A TR band was placed on the left wrist for hemostasis.  The access sheath was removed and no hematoma was seen. A radial artery pulse was confirmed distal to the puncture site confirming patent hemostasis.  The right common femoral artery was evaluated with ultrasound and seen to be patent. It was accessed using a 21-gauge micropuncture needle. A permanent image was stored to PACS. A wire was placed through the needle, and a 5 French vascular sheath was advanced into the right common femoral artery. Angiogram through the sheath confirmed appropriate access.

There is dense atherosclerotic calcification of the aortoiliac branches with Monckeberg vascular calcification identified diffusely. 2. The right common femoral artery is patent and compresses. Needle entry was stored to PACS. 3. Left common iliac injection shows the presence of a corona mortis.   4. Left external iliac arteriography shows a normal left inferior epigastric arterial origin. There is no active hemorrhage identified. 5. Left inferior epigastric arteriography shows diminutive branches and no obvious extravasation. 6. After Gelfoam embolization distally, there is no significant forward flow in the left inferior epigastric artery. 7. After deploying three 3 mm x 14 cm Nester possible coils, there is no antegrade flow in the left inferior epigastric branch with significant reflux down the leg and ongoing filling of the obturator branch. 8. The right groin is scarred.   Impression:  No active hemorrhage was identified in the left inferior epigastric artery. The branch was empirically embolized with Gelfoam slurry and coils.   Technique:  The right groin was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. The femoral vessels were ultrasonographically surveyed. Patency was documented and stored to PACS.   The common femoral artery was accessed via Seldinger technique and needle entry was stored to PACS.  A short 6 French vascular sheath was placed.  Over a 0.035\" wire a 4 French Sos catheter was reformed in the suprarenal abdominal aorta.  The bifurcation was traversed but the Bentson coursed into the internal iliac branch. Hand injected arteriography was performed and a Smart mask created. A Glidewire was negotiated into the external iliac artery and down the leg. The short sheath at the leg was exchanged for a long Balkan 6 French sheath. This could not be advanced over the bifurcation. An angled catheter was placed over the regular glide and the glide exchanged for a stiff glide. The sheath was then successfully advanced over the bifurcation and positioned in the contralateral, left common iliac artery.  The Cobra glide catheter was positioned in the external iliac artery and arteriography performed.  A 2.8 Progreat microcatheter was introduced coaxially and used to select the left inferior epigastric artery..   Arteriography was performed.   Embolization was carried out using Gelfoam slurry. Once antegrade flow had ceased, 3 pushable 0.018\" Nester coils (3 mm x 14 cm) were sequentially deployed. An additional coil deployment was attempted, however, the device malfunctioned and the coil was deployed in the catheter hub. Contrast injection showed no forward flow in the branch and the decision was made to terminate the procedure.    The images were reviewed.  The catheter was removed over a wire. The long 6 French sheath was replaced with a short 6 French sheath. During attempt to deploy a Vascade device, the sheath was inadvertently withdrawn precluding use of the device. Hemostasis was achieved with manual compression.  No immediate complication occurred, and the patient was discharged to the recovery area in satisfactory condition.

After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite, intubated, and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right radial artery under ultrasound guidance; a 5 French slender sheath was introduced into the right radial artery using ultrasound guidance. 3000 units of heparin, 200 mcg of nitroglycerin, 2.5 mg of verapamil were administered intra-arterially through the sheath after sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, the vessels listed above were selectively catheterized. Digital angiograms were performed of these vessels, centered over the head and neck.   Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a TR Band.  COMPARISON: Noninvasive imaging.  FINDINGS: RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. There is significant collateralization with the MCA territory on the right side via distal collaterals with the PCA territory with minimal delay in contrast filling. The bilateral AICA and SCA are normal in course caliber. In addition, Reflux of contrast into the contralateral vertebral artery was not achieved. The origin of PICA is normal unilaterally (we will defer to CTA for evaluation of the contralateral PICA).   RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is occlusion of the origin of the right MCA with mild nonflow limiting stenosis of the distal ICA. This is concordant with the noninvasive imaging. There there is significant neovascularization at the distal ICA which supplies a portion of the middle cerebral artery territory as well as numerous pial collaterals with the ACA territory supplying the majority of the hemisphere. There is minimal delay in contrast filling of the MCA territory through these collaterals. There is no aneurysm or early draining vein are identified. There is normal cortical venous drainage.  RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is mild to moderate stenosis at the distal ICA as well as moderate to severe stenosis of the origin of the left MCA consistent with early stage of moyamoya disease. The branches of the ACA and MCA are normal in course and caliber distal to the A1 and M1 segments respectively. There is no aneurysm or early draining vein are identified. There is normal cortical venous drainage.  LEFT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.    COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: The right internal carotid artery demonstrates occlusion of the origin of the right MCA with mild to moderate stenosis at the distal ICA while the left internal carotid has mild to moderate stenosis at the distal ICA with moderate to severe stenosis of the M1 segment of the left MCA. This is consistent with moyamoya disease. The right MCA territory is supplied primarily by distal collaterals from the PCA and ACA territories. There is mild delay in filling of the MCA territory via these distal collaterals.  [HCW], was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance. "}

Procedures:   Cholangiogram through existing catheter Biliary covered metallic stent placement Biliary catheter replacement             Findings: Comparison is made with replacement images from [DATE]. Abdominal MRI with MRCP from [DATE] was reviewed.  1. A small peritoneal loop is present on the scout film, easily reduced with gentle traction. 2. A long stricture extends from the cystic duct insertion to the ampulla,  3. After deploying the first stent, there is poor washout. After a second stent was deployed extending toward the duodenum, there is improved flow through the stent into duodenum. 4. The gallbladder fills. 5.  The new 12 French internal\/external biliary drain has its distal tip in the duodenum beyond the stent and sideholes extending into the right hepatic ducts.    Impression:  Malignant stricture of the common bile duct. A covered stent was successfully placed with persistently poor drainage. This prompted replacement of the 12 French internal\/external biliary drain with removal of the string mechanism and capping.  The intrahepatic bile ducts are not significantly dilated.  Treatment Plan:  Follow-up as scheduled for one month to assess the parenchymal tract and flow through the stents.  Technique:     The existing catheter and surrounding soft tissues were prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Local anesthetic was injected at the catheter entry site. The existing 12 French catheter was removed over an Amplatz wire. A short 10 French sheath was placed. A long coaxial sheath was placed and a pullback cholangiogram performed to assess stricture length. A marker pigtail was advanced over the wire and stent length determined.  A 10 mm x 10 cm covered viable stent was positioned fluoroscopically and deployed. It opened completely. Contrast injection showed persistent holdup with poor drainage to the duodenum. The stent was felt to be short and a second stent (10 mm x 6 cm) was deployed into the duodenum. Contrast injection showed persistently poor drainage with adequate stent positioning. The common hepatic duct was extremely dilated with initial cholangiography and it may simply be a system with large capacitance.  Over the Amplatz, a modified 12 French internal\/external biliary drain was placed and positioned fluoroscopically. The string mechanism was removed to prevent entanglement with the duodenal stent at future intervention. Contrast injection confirmed appropriate positioning. The tube was sutured in place and capped.  Because of frequent dislodgment, a Percu-Stay device was utilized.

OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] was the fellow. Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS CATHETERIZED: Right internal carotid artery Right common femoral artery  VESSELS TREATED (in sequence): Right internal carotid artery  ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. Pre-, intra-, and post-anesthesia monitoring records are available in the chart.  MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine 10 cc SQ Heparin 5000 units IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 6 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 0.035\" Bentson Guidewire 0.035\" Terumo Glidewire (180 cm) Benchmark long sheath (95 cm) Phenom 27 microcatheter (150 cm) Asahi 018 microguidewire (200 cm) 4.75 mm x 14 mm pipeline embolization device 6 French Angio-Seal closure device Omnipaque-300 contrast (80 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, stent thrombosis\/stenosis, stent migration, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, non-target embolization, puncture site hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite, intubated, and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 6 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 5000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement; additional boluses of heparin were administered at one-hour intervals. The ACT was checked to ensure that it was between 250-300. Using fluoroscopic guidance, benchmark was advanced into the right internal carotid artery. Digital angiograms were performed in the AP, lateral and oblique projections centered over the head and neck.   3D rotational angiography was performed with the long selection catheter in the right internal carotid artery artery to better delineate the aneurysm and parent vessel. The acquisition was processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.   Through the long selection catheter, 5 mg of intra-arterial milrinone was administered in the right internal carotid artery in pulse spray fashion over 10 minutes for treatment of catheter associated vasospasm.  Over the long selection catheter and 0.035\" Terumo Glidewire, the benchmark guide catheter was successfully advanced into the distal internal carotid artery. The Glidewire and long selection catheter were then removed. Through the long sheath a Phenom 27 microcatheter and Asahi 018 microguidewire was advanced into intracranial internal carotid artery.    A working projection was obtained to best demonstrate the neck of the superior hypophyseal aneurysm, as well as, the distal and proximal landing zones for the stent. Superselective catheterization of the right middle cerebral artery was performed with the Phenom 27 microcatheter over the Asahi 018 microguidewire. The tip of the microguidewire was situated in the M1 segment of the MCA. The microguidewire in the pipeline catheter was then exchanged for a 4.75 mm x 14 mm pipeline embolization device. The device was deployed under fluoroscopic guidance and a single shot X-ray was performed to confirm that the distal and proximal ends of the pipeline embolization device were in the communicating segment and right ICA cavernous segment, respectively. Postprocessing of the pipeline embolization device was performed with a curved microwire with successful improvement in apposition of the proximal and distal aspects of the device.  A final AP and Lateral angiogram were completed to evaluate the distal vasculature for perfusion deficits and emboli.   After completion of the procedure, the arteriotomy was above the level of the bifurcation and the CFA was of sufficient size to use the 6 French Angio-Seal closure device. Ancef was administered. The sheath was removed and hemostasis obtained using the 6 French Angio-Seal closure device. A Tegaderm were then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: Prior angiogram from [DATE].  FINDINGS:  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: The previously identified right superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm measuring 4.5 x 5 mm is unchanged in appearance. The ACA and MCA and its branches are normal in course and caliber. There is early washout of the ACA territory suggesting competitive flow from the contralateral hemisphere.  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION): he pipeline device has been deployed across the aneurysm neck in the distal internal carotid artery. There remains a small endoleak proximally as well as poor wall apposition distally. The decision was made to proceed with postprocessing with the microwire.  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-PROCESSING): The Pipeline device is well apposed to the vessel walls throughout it's course without endoleak. Stasis of contrast is noted within the aneurysm. . No perfusion deficits to suggest distal emboli are present.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY: A 3D rotational angiogram of the right internal carotid artery was completed and post-processed on an independent work station. 3D angiography revealed the previously described 4.5 x 5 mm inferiorly directed superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm without irregular features.  RIGHT COMMON FEMORAL ARTERY: No abnormalities are detected. The arteriotomy was above the level of the bifurcation and the CFA was of sufficient size to use the 6 French Angio-Seal closure device.   COMPLICATIONS: none immediate.  IMPRESSION:  1.\tSuccessful deployment of a pipeline flow diverting device across the previously described 4.5 x 5 mm inferiorly directed right superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm. Final angiogram demonstrates good wall apposition without evidence of endoleak. "}

Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right Internal Carotid Artery Right external carotid artery Left Internal Carotid Artery Left Vertebral Artery Right Vertebral Artery  ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia, see anesthesia MAR.  MEDICATIONS:  Heparin 3000 units IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.035\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Boston Scientific sheath 4 French Berenstein Glide catheter  Mynx Closure Device Visipaque-270 contrast material (120 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the right internal carotid artery for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the right internal carotid artery for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Mynx Closure Device followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Noninvasive imaging.  FINDINGS: RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a small aneurysm originating from the posterior wall of the proximal A1 segment of the ACA which is only clearly visualized on the three-dimensional reconstructions. The distal ACA and its branches are normal course and caliber. There is an anterior communicating artery with brief filling of the contralateral ACA territory. The distal ICA and its segments are normal in course and caliber . The MCA and its branches are normal course and caliber.   RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. The distal ICA and its segments are normal in course and caliber. The ACA and MCA and its branches are normal in course and caliber. There is normal cortical venous drainage.   LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Reflux of contrast into the right vertebral artery was not achieved. The origin of left PICA is normal.   RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Reflux of contrast into the left vertebral artery was not achieved. The right anterior inferior cerebellar artery is dominant and appears to supply the PICA territory. There is early contrast washout likely due to the proximal location of the diagnostic catheter.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated a 1.5 x 1.5 x 1 mm irregularly-shaped aneurysm originating from the posterior wall of the proximal A1 segment of the right ACA.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated no underlying aneurysmal dilatation.   COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: There is a 1.5 x 1.5 x 1 mm irregularly-shaped aneurysm originating from the posterior wall of the proximal A1 segment of the right ACA. This is likely the source the patient's underlying subarachnoid hemorrhage. No other vascular abnormalities are visualized in this angiogram.     "}

There is normal cortical venous drainage.  LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: The previously deployed left ICA stent is patent and without in-stent stenosis. There is no residual aneurysm. There is a small left posterior communicating artery infundibulum without aneurysmal features. The the ACA and MCA and its branches are normal in course and caliber. The bilateral ACA territories fill from the left A1 segment which is concordant with the contralateral injection.  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Reflux of contrast into the contralateral vertebral artery was not achieved. The origin of PICA is normal unilaterally (we will defer to CTA for evaluation of the contralateral PICA). This run is limited by early washout of contrast into the distal location of the catheter.   COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: No residual filling of the previously described bilateral ICA aneurysms. The bilateral flow diverting stents are patent and without in-stent stenosis.

High pressures during dialysis.  Procedure:  1. Fluoroscopic guided exchange of tunneled PermCath catheter. 2. Limited superior vena cavagram.   Findings:  1. Scout image demonstrates existing right IJ tunneled PermCath with tip positioned at the cavoatrial junction\/distal SVC. 2. Superior vena cavagram demonstrates irregularity and narrowing of the distal SVC without significant holdup of contrast. 3. Newly exchanged right IJ tunneled PermCath is appropriately positioned with the tip in the right atrium. Postexchange venogram confirms appropriate position without any abnormality.  Impression:  1. Pre-existing PermCath terminates at the lower SVC\/cavoatrial junction. Venogram through the catheter demonstrates irregularity and narrowing of the distal SVC without significant flow limitation. 2. Uneventful image guided wire exchange of a right IJ tunneled PermCath catheter (15.5 French by 23 cm tip to cuff).   Plan:  1. New catheter is ready for immediate use.  2. Patient follow-up in IR clinic for further consideration of SVC venogram and possible venoplasty.  Technique:  The right chest wall and area immediately around the existing double lumen Hickman catheter was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier.  Using local anesthetic, the tract was anesthetized. Utilizing a hemostat, the tract was accessed and the cuff freed from the surrounding soft tissues.   An Amplatz wire was advanced through the catheter however was not easily navigated through the SVC and down the IVC. Given the difficulty, venogram was performed, which demonstrated filling defect around the tip of the catheter, with contrast retrograde filling and eventually dumping through the atrium and out the pulmonary outflow tract.  A Glidewire advantage was then easily navigated into the IVC.  Given the patient's current lack of IV access, and no sedation, the decision was made to just exchange the catheter over a wire and bring the patient back at a later date for SVC venography and possible stenting.  The catheter was then pulled with gentle traction until it was completely removed over the wire.   A new double lumen PermCath was advanced over the wire until the tip was positioned appropriately and the cuff positioned within the tunnel. Prolene suture was placed at the catheter tunnel exit site. An antimicrobial disc and sterile dressing were applied.  The catheter was aspirated, flushed, and heparinized per protocol. The procedure was well tolerated, and the patient was discharged in satisfactory condition.

Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, hemorrhage, renal failure, limb loss, death, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.  After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and general anesthesia initiated and endotracheal intubation was performed by anesthesia staff. An XperCT was performed in order to confirm appropriate EVD placement and to evaluate for post EVD hemorrhage. The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained by a single-wall puncture of the right common femoral artery. An angiogram of the right common femoral artery was performed through the outer cannula the dilator to ensure the arteriotomy was appropriately placed into the artery was reasonable for use of the Perclose device. A 6 French 65cm Arrow sheath was introduced Seldinger technique and was advanced over the Bentson wire into the proximal descending aorta using fluoroscopic guidance.  Using fluoroscopic guidance, the 5 French diagnostic catheter was used to select the left vertebral artery and the bilateral external and internal carotid arteries.  Digital angiograms were performed of these vessels, centered over the head. Ipsilateral and contralateral oblique projections were obtained of both internal carotid artery injections to evaluate for anterior communicating or MCA bifurcation aneurysms.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the proximal cervical segment of the right internal carotid artery for better delineation of the intracranial vasculature. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.  The 5 French diagnostic catheter was then exchanged over the 0.035\" [VENDOR]umo exchange-length glidewire for the 072 Navien guide catheter, which was situated at the distal cervical segment of the right internal carotid artery. The balloon was then prepared on an adjacent table, and the microguidewire and the balloon were passed coaxially through the guide catheter into the right internal carotid artery. The guide catheter was advanced over the microcatheter in the balloon into the horizontal petrous segment of the right internal carotid artery. Using roadmap guidance, the balloon was advanced to cover the ostium of the aneurysm. Superselective catheterization of the right posterior communicating artery aneurysm performed with the microcatheter over a microguidewire. The aneurysm was framed and filled with the aforementioned coils using roadmap and blank roadmap technique. Following the deployment of the first coil, an aspirin rectal suppository (300 mg) was administered. The balloon was inflated and deflated under fluoroscopic guidance as needed in order to remodel the aneurysm neck and wall the coiling catheter was removed from the aneurysm.   A final cerebral angiogram was done in the AP and lateral projection to evaluate for residual filling, and distal emboli.  Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine and Ancef was administered.  Hemostasis was achieved by application of a Perclose ProGlide. A Tegaderm was then applied over the puncture site.

Leaking gastrostomy tube  Additional clinical history: Pancreatic cancer status post Whipple in [DATE] with biliary anastomotic obstruction. A 10.2 French internal\/external biliary drain was placed on [DATE]. The 10.2 French catheter was replaced and a biopsy performed at the anastomosis on [DATE]. The catheter was again replaced due to leakage at the skin site on [DATE]. She was hospitalized with gastric outlet obstruction and had a 20 French PEG tube placed endoscopically. The catheter was again replaced on [DATE] due to leaking at the skin entry site. Leaking continued and on [DATE] the biliary drain was upsized to 12 French. In spite of of an adequately positioned drain, the catheter continues to leak at the catheter entry site. In addition, the gastrostomy tube has profuse leakage around the catheter in the left upper quadrant.   PROCEDURE: 1. Catheter cholangiogram 2.

Gastrostomy tube replacement and upsizing to 22 French    FINDINGS: Comparison is made to multiple prior studies dating back to [DATE].  1.  Cholangiogram through the existing 12 French biliary drainage catheter demonstrates leakage beneath the skin outside the liver. 2. There is ongoing ductal prominence with debris. 3. The newly placed, larger 16 French biliary drain has its proximal sideholes barely within the right sided bile ducts, well central to the point of access. 4. There is significant retained gastric content. It is thick and not drained by the PEG tube. 5. The newly placed venting gastrostomy tube is a longer catheter with sideholes extending up into the fundus. Leakage at the skin is resolved.   IMPRESSION:   1.  Uneventful biliary catheter upsizing from 12 Fre[HOSPITAL] to 16 French with a different type drain placed with sideholes much more central. 2. The gastrostomy tube was replaced with a larger 22 French modified gastrostomy tube to improve drainage.  PLAN:  The gastrostomy tube will need to be flushed several times daily due to the viscosity\/thickness of the gastric content. Catheter maintenance on a p.r.n. basis.   TECHNIQUE:    The existing biliary and gastrostomy catheters and surrounding soft tissues were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.   Biliary drain replacement:   Contrast was injected through the existing biliary drain, demonstrating leakage beneath the skin laterally. A 0.035\" glidewire was negotiated through the catheter into the small bowel.  The catheter was removed and a new 16 French internal\/external biliary drain was placed over the  wire .  Contrast was injected to confirm tube position.  The tube was sutured in place with 2-0 Ethilon and capped.     Attention was redirected to the existing 20 French endoscopically placed leaking gastrostomy tube.  Gastrostomy tube revision:  The existing gastrostomy tube was advanced into the fundus. There was significant retained residual which was quite thick and returned poorly through the existing gastrostomy tube.

Leaking gastrostomy tube  Additional clinical history: Pancreatic cancer status post Whipple in [DATE] with biliary anastomotic obstruction. A 10.2 French internal\/external biliary drain was placed on [DATE]. The 10.2 French catheter was replaced and a biopsy performed at the anastomosis on [DATE]. The catheter was again replaced due to leakage at the skin site on [DATE]. She was hospitalized with gastric outlet obstruction and had a 20 French PEG tube placed endoscopically. The catheter was again replaced on [DATE] due to leaking at the skin entry site. Leaking continued and on [DATE] the biliary drain was upsized to 12 French. In spite of of an adequately positioned drain, the catheter continues to leak at the catheter entry site. In addition, the gastrostomy tube has profuse leakage around the catheter in the left upper quadrant.   PROCEDURE: 1. Catheter cholangiogram 2. Internal\/external biliary drain replacement with upsizing to 16 French. 3. Gastrostomy tube replacement and upsizing to 22 French    FINDINGS: Comparison is made to multiple prior studies dating back to [DATE].  1.  Cholangiogram through the existing 12 French biliary drainage catheter demonstrates leakage beneath the skin outside the liver. 2. There is ongoing ductal prominence with debris. 3. The newly placed, larger 16 French biliary drain has its proximal sideholes barely within the right sided bile ducts, well central to the point of access. 4. There is significant retained gastric content. It is thick and not drained by the PEG tube. 5. The newly placed venting gastrostomy tube is a longer catheter with sideholes extending up into the fundus. Leakage at the skin is resolved.   IMPRESSION:   1.  Uneventful biliary catheter upsizing from 12 Fre[HOSPITAL] to 16 French with a different type drain placed with sideholes much more central. 2. The gastrostomy tube was replaced with a larger 22 French modified gastrostomy tube to improve drainage.  PLAN:  The gastrostomy tube will need to be flushed several times daily due to the viscosity\/thickness of the gastric content. Catheter maintenance on a p.r.n. basis.   TECHNIQUE:    The existing biliary and gastrostomy catheters and surrounding soft tissues were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.   Biliary drain replacement:   Contrast was injected through the existing biliary drain, demonstrating leakage beneath the skin laterally. A 0.035\" glidewire was negotiated through the catheter into the small bowel.  The catheter was removed and a new 16 French internal\/external biliary drain was placed over the  wire .  Contrast was injected to confirm tube position.  The tube was sutured in place with 2-0 Ethilon and capped.     Attention was redirected to the existing 20 French endoscopically placed leaking gastrostomy tube.  Gastrostomy tube revision:  The existing gastrostomy tube was advanced into the fundus. There was significant retained residual which was quite thick and returned poorly through the existing gastrostomy tube.  Through the existing PEG tube, the stomach was insufflated, once the window was adequate, Two T-tacks were deployed to appose the anterior gastric wall to the anterior abdominal wall.

An anterior compression deformity is present at L4. There is marrow edema. A chronic compression deformity is present at L3. 2. Post procedure images show good interdigitation of methacrylate across the midline.    Impression:  Uneventful bipedicular kyphoplasty at L4.  Technique:  The patient was placed prone on the Angiography table.  The back was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The C-Arm was brought into position and the L4 pedicles were identified and marked on the skin with a sterile marker. In view of the pedicle size and collapse of the L4 fracture, a transpedicular approach into the vertebral body was determined appropriate.   Under fluoroscopic guidance and through a left transpedicular approach, an 11-gauge trocar needle was advanced to just beyond the junction of the pedicle and L4 vertebral body. Needle tip position was confirmed in the AP and lateral planes to ensure the medial wall of the pedicle was not violated. A coaxial drill was placed through  the outer cannula and  advanced to the anterior third of the vertebral body toward the midline under multiplanar fluoroscopic guidance.  Attention was then turned to the contralateral side, where under fluoroscopic guidance via a right transpedicular approach, an 11-gauge trocar was advanced to just beyond the junction of the pedicle and L4 vertebral body. Needle tip position was confirmed in the AP and lateral planes to ensure the medial wall of the pedicle was not violated. The coaxial drill was advanced to the anterior third of the vertebral body toward the midline under multiplanar fluoroscopic guidance.    After completing the bilateral trocar entry into the vertebral body, inflatable bone tamps were inserted through each cannula respectively and advanced under lateral fluoroscopic guidance into the vertebral body proximal to the anterior cortex.  The balloon tamps were positioned such that the radiopaque marker bands were identified and situated just posterior to the anterior margin of the vertebral body.  Under multiplanar fluoroscopic imaging, the balloon bone tamps were inflated sequentially.  The inflations were monitored with AP and lateral imaging.  There was no breach of the lateral wall or anterior cortex of the vertebral body.  Internal fixation was achieved with low pressure injection of bone cement.

Needle entry was documented. 2.\tRight hepatic venogram confirms vein patency. 3.\tPortogram demonstrates patent splenic and portal veins. Moderate-sized short gastric and left gastric varices extending to the lower esophagus are noted. 4.\tThe initial portosystemic gradient is 16 mmHg. 5.\tPost-TIPSS portosystemic gradient is 9 mmHg. 6.\tThe TIPSS extends from the right hepatic vein to right portal vein. 7.\tThere is good flow through the shunt at the conclusion of the procedure with no appreciable filling of varices. 8.\tTechnically successful antegrade transvenous obliteration of dominant gastroesophageal varices using STS foam and coils. 9.\tNew right internal jugular approach triple-lumen catheter terminates at the superior cavoatrial junction.  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful creation of TIPS from right hepatic vein to right portal vein with three overlapping 8-10 mm controlled-expansion Viatorr stents (ballooned to 10 mm).  2.\tSuccessful antegrade transvenous obliteration of gastroesophageal varices. 3.\tThe portosystemic gradient was reduced from 16 mm Hg to 9 mmHg.  Treatment Plan:   1.\tPatient will be admitted to ICU for overnight monitoring 2.\tPatient will be started on Lactulose\/rifaximin  Technique:   Following written informed consent, the patient was placed supine on the procedure table. After induction of general anesthesia, the right neck and abdomen were prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.   Access: The right neck was then evaluated with ultrasound. The skin overlying the right internal jugular vein was anesthetized with local, and a small dermatotomy was made.  Under ultrasound guidance a 21-gauge needle was advanced into the right internal jugular vein. A 0.018\" guidewire was advanced through the micropuncture needle. The needle was exchanged for a 5 French transitional catheter. The 0.018\" wire and inner dilator were removed, and a 0.035\" wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava.  The transitional catheter was exchanged for a sheath. An angled catheter was placed over the wire and used to select the right hepatic vein. A right hepatic venogram was obtained.   Notes on access catheter\/sheath combination: MPA\/10-Fr sheath  ICE (Intra-cardiac echo) technique: A second access site was obtained in the neck using ultrasound guidance and a vascular sheath. This sheath was guided using fluoroscopy into the hepatic venous confluence and utilized to advance the ICE. Real-time echo imaging was then utilized to target an appropriate portal radical, with attention paid to avoid traversal of critical intrahepatic vessels\/bile ducts and extrahepatic structures.  Pre-TIPS Pressures:  Right atrial and direct portal pressure measurements were obtained using a catheter\/sheath, as detailed:  Right atrial: 30 mm Hg Portal: 14 mm Hg  CO2 Portography: No  TIPS: Using the Argon ScorpionX TIPS set, the right portal vein was accessed, which was confirmed with the hand-injection of contrast. A 0.035\" wire was advanced into the portal vein and the TIPS sheaths were advanced over the wire into the portal vein. The inner sheath was removed and a marking pigtail catheter was advanced over the guidewire and used to measure the parenchymal tract and measure portal venous pressure. The sheath was ultimately advanced into the main portal vein, and a 8-10 mm x 2 cm x 8 cm Viatorr stent was deployed within the TIPS shunt. The [HOSPITAL]nt was dilated throughout using a high pressure balloon. Follow-up portogram demonstrated sluggish flow through the TIPS shunt due to tortuous course of the stent from acute access angle at the right portal vein. Two additional overlapping Viatorr stents (8-10 mm x 2 cm x 4 cm) were deployed proximal and distal to the existing stent to reinforce\/reduce the tortuous angulation.  Post-TIPS Pressures: The pressures after shunt placement and stent dilation to 8 mm were recorded, as follows: Direct portal: 31 mm Hg Right atrial: 15 mmHg This corresponds to a portosystemic gradient of 16 mm Hg  The pressures after shunt placement and stent dilation to 10 mm were recorded, as follows: Direct portal: 24 mm Hg Right atrial: 15 mmHg This corresponds to a portosystemic gradient of 9 mm Hg   Antegrade Transvenous Obliteration of varices: Through the existing TIPS access, a 5 French catheter and wire combination was used to gain access into the dominant gastroesophageal varix arising at the portal mesenteric confluence. A 2.8 French prograde microcatheter was introduced into the base catheter. Contrast was injected. Images were reviewed and stored to PACS. Through the microcatheter, a 2 mL of STS foam mixture (1:2:3, lipiodol:STS:air) was injected into the varix. This was followed by coil embolization of the gastroesophageal varix using Balt Prestige coils (10 mm x 45 cm, 12 mm x 65 cm, 9 mm x 45 cm). After embolization, contrast was injected through the microcatheter. Images were reviewed.  At the end of the procedure the sheath was removed over a guidewire and a 12 French x 16 cm triple lumen catheter was placed. The catheter was flushed and heparinized per protocol. The catheter was sutured to the skin with 2-0 suture and a biodisc and sterile dressing were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.

The skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the left internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle. An image was saved and stored to PACS.    A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, however there was is difficulty advancing the 0.018 inch wire to the IVC. Given the ultrasound access imaging, and venous appearance of the blood return from the needle, we were confident to be in the venous system, and a 5 French transitional sheath was advanced over the wire to establish stable access into the vein. An Amplatz wire was then attempted to be advanced into the IVC, again unsuccessful. The outer of the 5 French transitional sheath was exchanged for a 4 French Kumpe catheter for directionality. Through the Kumpe catheter, the Amplatz wire was successfully advanced into the IVC.  Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the dialysis catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.

{"ReportID":7321278,"ContentText_DEID":"Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Female Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL].[ID].[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  Prolonged hospitalization status post bilateral orthotopic lung transplant. Now requiring dialysis with need for PermCath. Needs long-term IV access. Also has malfunctioning Kangaroo GJ.  Procedure:   1.\tTunneled large bore central venous catheter placement  Findings:   1.\tThe right internal jugular vein is occluded. The brachiocephalic vein isn't accessible to the patient's tracheostomy and body configuration. A small right external jugular vein is patent. 2.\tAfter placement of the large and small bore central venous catheters, as described, both catheter tips terminate in the right atrium. 3.\tThe existing Kangaroo GJ tube has a fundal loop and terminates in the gastric antrum. An occluding plug was dislodged with injection through the J port. This tube was ultimately replaced for a new 18 French 45 cm MIC gastrojejunostomy tube.    Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a  15.5 French, 19 cm (tip-to-cuff), tunneled large bore central venous catheter via the right external jugular vein. 2.\tUncomplicated image guided placement of 5 French, 24 cm, tunneled small bore central venous catheter via the right external jugular vein. Successful removal and replacement of the existing GJ for and the new GJ tube above.  Treatment Plan:   1. Both catheters are available for immediate use. 2. The GJ tube is available for immediate use.   Technique:  Line placement:  The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).   The skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating occlusion, however the right external jugular vein appeared patent. Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle. An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle down to the IVC. At this point, given there would be 2 lines placed, examination of the anterior chest soft tissues was performed in plans for tunneling. The decision was made to obtain another venous access before any tunneling greater line placement approximately 1 cm more medial from the initial access. Over the existing access, the needle was removed, and a 5 French peel-away sheath was placed over the wire.   Under direct ultrasound guidance, the vessel was accessed using a new micropuncture needle. A wire was advanced around the IVC, and the needle was exchanged for a 5 French micropuncture transitional s[HCW].  Now with the 2 stable accesses in place, attention was turned to creating the tunnel. Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the dialysis catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The venotomy tract of the medial access was dilated to allow introduction of a peel-away sheath.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.  The tunneling device loaded with the smallbore catheter was then used to bring this through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy. The catheter was cut to the appropriate length; and then fed through the peel-away sheath.  The catheters were sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.    Gastrojejunostomy evaluation\/replacement: Attention was then turned to the existing can grew GJ. A fundal loop was noted. Upon initial evaluation, there was resistance to injection of the tube; which was resolved with consistent forceful injection of contrast\/saline. Cine fluoroscopy images were stored to PACS. A wire was then advanced through the pre-existing GJ. The wire was able to be easily advanced postpyloric and into the jejunum however the fundal loop could not be successfully reduced using various techniques including Fogarty balloon advancement (would not advance through the existing J portion possibly due to residual intraluminal narrowing).  Ultimately the decision was made to remove the GJ in its entirety and give up the access. Through the pre-existing percutaneous tract, a Kumpe catheter and stiff Glidewire were navigated to the pylorus, into the duodenum, and into the jejunum. The Kumpe catheter was removed over the wire, and a new 18 French MIC GJ tube was advanced over the wire into the jejunum. The balloon was injected with dilute contrast within the stomach. Contrast injection through both the jejunostomy and gastrostomy ports confirmed adequate positioning. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complication.

OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] was the fellow. Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right Internal Carotid Artery Right External Carotid Artery Left Internal Carotid Artery Left External Carotid Artery Left Vertebral Artery   ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia was administered under the supervision of the attending anesthesiologist. Pre-, intra-, and post-anesthesia monitoring records are available in the chart.  MEDICATIONS:  Heparin 3000 units IV Protamine 20 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 F[HOSPITAL] micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 6 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter  Visipaque-270 contrast material (120 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the right internal carotid artery for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the left internal carotid artery for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. The sheath was left in place and on a heparinized saline drip in preparation for an intraoperative angiogram. Patient brought directly to the OR from the angiography suite.  COMPARISON: Noninvasive imaging.  FINDINGS:  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a highly irregular multilobulated right posterior communicating artery aneurysm measuring up to 5.5 mm in maximal diameter and 5 mm in depth. There is a small lobule which is likely the site of hemorrhage which measures 2.3 x 2.1 mm. The neck of this aneurysm is 4.5 mm and the posterior communicating artery originates off the inferior aspect of the aneurysm. This is better delineated on the three-dimensional reconstructions. In addition, there is aneurysmal dilatation of the supraclinoid right ICA. There are some minor irregularities around the anterior communicating artery without clear aneurysmal features although follow-up is advised. The MCA and its branches are normal course and caliber. There is normal cortical venous drainage.  RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a 10 x 6mm left ophthalmic artery segment aneurysm with a 6 mm base. There is a small irregular outpouching in the inferior aspect of the aneurysm. Incidental note is made of a cavernous origin of the left ophthalmic artery. The ACA and MCA and its branches are normal course and caliber. There is normal cortical venous drainage.  LEFT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Reflux of contrast into the contralateral vertebral artery was achieved. The origin of PICA is normal bilaterally. The basilar artery and its segments are normal course and caliber. There is a patulous basilar tip without clear aneurysmal features.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated a multilobulated an irregularly-shaped right posterior communicating artery aneurysm measuring 5.5 x 5 mm. There is a small distal lobule measuring 2.3 x 2.1 mm. The neck is aneurysm is 4.5 mm in the posterior communicating artery originates off the inferior portion of the aneurysm.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated large para ophthalmic artery aneurysm measuring 10 x 5 mm with a 6 mm neck. Note is made of a cavernous origin of the ophthalmic artery.   COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: There is a multilobulated and irregularly-shaped right posterior indicating artery aneurysm measuring 5.5 x 5 mm with a small distal lobule measuring 2.3 x 2.1 mm the posterior communicating artery originates at the inferior portion of the aneurysm. Note is made of a prominent P1 segment of the right PCA. This is thought to be the cause of the patient's underlying aneurysmal rupture for which the patient is to proceed to the OR for surgical clipping.  In addition to the right posterior communicator artery aneurysm, there is a left ophthalmic artery segment aneurysm measuring 10 x 6 mm. Incidental note is made of a cavernous origin of the left ophthalmic artery."}

PROCEDURE:  1. Diagnostic cerebral angiogram. 2. Intra-arterial non-thrombolytic infusion with follow-up study, right internal carotid artery  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 30 minutes.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. He participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right Internal Carotid Artery Right External Carotid Artery Left Internal Carotid Artery Left External Carotid Artery Right Vertebral Artery   ANESTHESIA: Local in the right groin with bupivacaine. Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by the nurse present during the entire procedure. The patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Sedation was administered by a specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for the duration of the procedure as outlined above (Total intra service time, 30 ). Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Versed 1.5 mg IV Fentanyl 100 mcg IV Heparin 3000 units IV Protamine 20 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter  Cardiva Vascade Omnipaque-300 contrast material (80 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   After the initial angiogram of the right internal carotid artery, 15 mg of verapamil were infused over 10 minutes into the right internal carotid artery. Interval angiography was performed 10 minutes later which demonstrated no improvement of the diffuse pattern of vasculopathy.  Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Vascade followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Noninvasive imaging.  FINDINGS:  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  Diffuse vasculopathy affecting medium to small caliber vessels in the right anterior circulation, with moderate to severe stenosis in a diffuse pattern throughout both the anterior and middle cerebral artery territories. Focal segmental areas of stenosis and poststenotic dilatation are noted, particularly in the right inferior M2 with beading of the superior and inferior parietal arteries. There is no significant vasculopathy affecting the internal carotid artery although there may be some mild tapering at the terminus. The A1 segment is moderately involved with mild changes in the right M1 segment. No definitive evidence of an aneurysm or venous shunt.  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST VASODILATOR INFUSION): No interval improvement of the diffuse pattern of vasculopathy.   RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: Diffuse vasculopathy affecting medium to small caliber vessels in the left anterior circulation, with moderate to severe stenosis in a diffuse pattern throughout the anterior and middle cerebral artery territories. As on the right side, the anterior cerebral artery territories appear to be more diffusely affected. Focal areas of stenosis and poststenotic dilatation are noted throughout both territories. There is mild to moderate involvement of the proximal left M1 and A1 segments.  LEFT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: Diffuse vasculopathy affecting primarily medium more so than smaller vessel caliber arteries and posterior circulation. The right posterior inferior cerebellar artery, bilateral superior cerebellar arteries, and bilateral posterior cerebral arteries are affected. There is no significant vasculopathy of the vertebral or basilar arteries. Retrograde opacification of the distal left ACA territory is noted along with some retrograde filling of the left MCA territory. No evidence of aneurysm or focal shunting.  COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: 1. Diffuse, moderate to severe vasculopathy primarily affecting moderate more so than small caliber vessels in the bilateral anterior circulation as well as the posterior circulation. There is notable absence of significant vasculopathy in the large vessels including the basilar, internal carotid, and vertebral arteries. The pattern is too diffuse and severe to be consistent with intracranial atherosclerotic disease, particularly in the absence of any significant atherosclerotic burden in the cervical arteries or aortic arch. Further evaluation will be necessary to assess for underlying inflammatory versus infectious vasculopathies.  2. No response to an intra-arterial vasodilator trial; in specific, there was no relaxation of the multifocal stenoses after 15 mg of verapamil infusion."}

Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, stent thrombosis\/stenosis, stent migration, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, non-target embolization, puncture site hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the [HOSPITAL]ngiography suite, intubated, and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery. Through the dilator sheath, an angiogram of the of the right common femoral artery was obtained to ensure the arteriotomy was above the level of the bifurcation and the CFA was of sufficient size to use the Perclose ProGlide closure device. An 6 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 5000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement; additional boluses of heparin were administered at one-hour intervals. The ACT was checked to ensure that it was between 250-300. Using fluoroscopic guidance,  the arteries  listed above were selectively catheterized. Digital angiograms were performed in the AP, lateral and oblique projections centered over the head and neck. We visualized a small amount of vasospasm in the petrous segment of the internal carotid artery and infused 10 mg of verapamil over 10 minutes into the right internal carotid artery.  3D rotational angiography was performed with the long selection catheter in the right internal carotid artery to better delineate the right ophthalmic artery aneurysm. The acquisition was processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced. Over the Bentson guidewire, the benchmark was successfully advanced into the distal petrous internal carotid artery. The Bentson wire was removed.   A working projection was obtained to best demonstrate the neck of the ophthalmic artery aneurysm, as well as, the distal and proximal landing zones for the stent. Superselective catheterization of the middle cerebral artery was performed with the [VENDOR]om 27 microcatheter over the Asahi 018 microguidewire. The tip of the microguidewire was situated in the middle cerebral artery. The microguidewire in the pipeline catheter was then exchanged for a 4 mm x 10 mm pipeline embolization device. The device was deployed under fluoroscopic guidance and a single shot X-ray was performed to confirm that the distal and proximal ends of the pipeline embolization device were in the communicating segment and right ICA cavernous segment, respectively. No postprocessing of the pipeline embolization device was required.  A final AP and Lateral angiogram were completed to evaluate the distal vasculature for perfusion deficits and emboli.   After completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Ancef was administered. The sheath was removed and hemostasis obtained using the Perclose ProGlide closure device. A Tegaderm were then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: Cerebral angiogram [DATE].  FINDINGS:  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a ophthalmic artery aneurysm, better described on the 3-D angiogram below. The aneurysm is stable compared to prior. There is an infundibular origin of the posterior communicating artery. There is no evidence of focal stenosis or early draining vein are identified.    RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION): The Pipeline device is well apposed to the vessel walls throughout it's course without endoleak. . The distal end of the device slightly covers the origin of the posterior communicating artery and the proximal end of the device is located at the anterior genu.

Transcatheter embolization: Embolic: nbca\/glue Details (type\/size\/volume\/number):  Glue: Lipiodol 1:3 concentration Total of 3 cc administered.  IMPRESSION:   Extremely technically challenging, however ultimately successful successful glue embolization of the bleeding jejunal artery.  TREATMENT PLAN:  1. Continued clinical and laboratory monitoring recommended. Please contact interventional radiology if there is a change in clinical status. 2. Routine post-angiography groin cares ordered.  TECHNIQUE: With the patient in the supine position, the groin was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. Following standard prepping and draping, the left common femoral artery was punctured using a needle. Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. A image could unfortunately cannot be saved due to patient acuity. An 0.035\" Bentson wire was advanced into the aorta. A vascular sheath was placed over the wire into the common femoral artery. A side flush was started.  A 5-Fr Cobra C2 diagnostic catheter was advanced over an 0.035\" wire into the abdominal aorta. The catheter was used to first select the superior mesenteric artery. An angiogram was performed and demonstrated brisk contrast extravasation correlating with the imaging findings and preoperative CTA.  Using a Truselect 2.0 microcatheter and Transend microwire a small side branch off the jejunal J1 artery was catheterized. A subselective angiogram demonstrated that this indeed was the bleeding artery. The above glue embolization was performed, and multiple angiograms from the base catheter demonstrated cessation of active bleeding.  The Cobra catheter was then used to select celiac artery, and angiogram demonstrated no active arterial extravasation. Of note, the gastroduodenal artery did not readily opacified.   At the end of the celiac artery angiogram, the previously seen glue cast near the loop of bowel with contrast extravasation was noted, appear to have migrated. The superior mesenteric artery was then re-catheterized with the Cobra catheter, and angiogram demonstrated reconstitution of the active hemorrhage.  The above microwire\/microcatheter system was then used to reattempt catheterizing the bleeding jejunal branch, however unsuccessful. Extensive different combinations of various microwires and microcatheters were also then utilized, with significant difficulty catheterizing the side branch of the jejunal artery.  The patient was significantly decompensating with anesthesiology noting blood coring out from adjacent to the nasojejunal tube. Given the concern that we would not be able to control the hemorrhage endovascularly, surgery was immediately consults for further recommendations.  During their assessment work up of the patient, were finally able to recatheterized the bleeding jejunal sidebranch, and more glue in a 3:1 concentration was used to embolize the vessel. Minimal glue reflux back into the main vessel. Postembolization angiography demonstrated preserved opacification of the distal J1B on the small side branch embolized, with overall preserved perfusion of the small bowel. No further active extravasation was noted.  A left common femoral artery angiogram was performed, demonstrating appropriate vascular access above the profunda femoris artery bifurcation.

After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion after intubation by the anesthesiology team. Access to the vascular system was gained by a single-wall puncture of the right common femoral artery. A 5 French long sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery  using Seldinger technique.  Using fluoroscopic guidance, the 5 French diagnostic catheter was used to select the left common carotid artery and the right common carotid artery.  Digital angiograms were performed of these vessels, centered over the head. Ipsilateral and contralateral oblique projections were obtained of both internal carotid artery injections to evaluate for anterior communicating or MCA bifurcation aneurysms.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY: Rotational angiography was also performed from the Simmons catheter in the right common carotid artery for better delineation of the intracranial vasculature. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY: Rotational angiography was also performed from the Simmons catheter in the right common carotid artery for better delineation of the intracranial vasculature. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.  Following the diagnostic angiogram, an aspirin rectal suppository (300 mg) was administered in preparation for coiling. Additional heparin was administered to target an ACT goal of 200-300. We then advanced the benchmark guide catheter over the [HOSPITAL] [VENDOR] select catheter to select the right common carotid artery. We then advanced an 035 Terumo Glidewire up to the petrous segment of the right internal carotid artery to obtain support and then advanced the diagnostic catheter and then the benchmark into the right internal carotid artery. We then removed the diagnostic catheter and Glidewire and obtained her working projections. Superselective catheterization of the right middle cerebral  artery aneurysm performed with the microcatheter over a microguidewire.   The aneurysm was framed and filled with the aforementioned coil using roadmap and blank roadmap technique.    A final cerebral angiogram was done in the AP and lateral projection to evaluate for residual filling, and distal emboli.  Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine.  An angiogram of the right common femoral artery was obtained to confirm that the arterial puncture was above the bifurcation that the vessels of adequate size to use a Perclose ProGlide.

Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, hemorrhage, renal failure, limb loss, death, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.  After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion after intubation by the anesthesiology team. Access to the vascular system was gained by a single-wall puncture of the right common femoral artery. A 6 French short sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery  using Seldinger technique.  Using fluoroscopic guidance, the 5 French diagnostic catheter was used to select the bilateral internal carotid arteries and the left vertebral artery.  Digital angiograms were performed of these vessels, centered over the head. Ipsilateral and contralateral oblique projections were obtained of both internal carotid artery injections to evaluate for anterior communicating or MCA bifurcation aneurysms.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY: Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the left vertebral artery for better delineation of the intracranial vasculature. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.  Following the diagnostic angiogram, an aspirin rectal suppository (300 mg) was administered in preparation for coiling. The 5 French diagnostic catheter was then exchanged over the 0.035\" [VENDOR] exchange-length glidewire for the 071 [VENDOR]umbra Benchmark guide catheter, which was situated at the V2 3 junction of the left vertebral artery. Superselective catheterization of the right superior cerebellar artery branch distal to the prenidal aneurysm was selected. Trufill n-BCA liquid embolic was prepared on the back table and following infusion of dextrose solution, was injected under blank roadmap technique. The microcatheter was removed without difficulty. A control angiogram was performed to assess for distal emboli. A headway 17 microcatheter was subsequently advanced into the right superior cerebellar artery prenidal aneurysm performed with the microcatheter over a microguidewire.   The aneurysm was framed and filled with the aforementioned coils using roadmap and blank roadmap technique.   A final cerebral angiogram was done in the AP and lateral projection to evaluate for residual filling, and distal emboli.  Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine.  An angiogram of the right common femoral artery was obtained to confirm that the arterial puncture was above the bifurcation that the vessels of adequate size to use a mynx closure device. Ancef was administered.  Hemostasis was achieved by application of a mynx closure device. A Tegaderm was then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: None.  FINDINGS:  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. The distal ICA and its segments are normal course and caliber. The MCA and its branches are normal in course and caliber. The A1 segment of the right ACA is hypoplastic with early washout of the distal ACA territory suggesting dominant filling from the contralateral hemisphere.   RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is brief filling of the midline superior cerebellar arteriovenous malformation via collaterals from the left posterior cerebral artery. This will be described in further detail on the left vertebral injection. The distal ICA and its segments are normal course and caliber. The posterior communicating artery is dominant supplies the posterior cerebral territory. The MCA and its branches are normal course and caliber. The ACA supplies the bilateral ACA territories. This is concordant with the contralateral internal injection. There are no aneurysms identified on the anterior right circulation.   LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a midline superior cerebellar arteriovenous malformation supplied primarily by branches of the right superior cerebellar artery and small branches off the right posterior cerebral artery. The nidus measures 2 x 2 cm and drainage primarily into the right basal vein of Rosenthal and vein of Galen. There is a large highly irregularly-shaped right superior cerebellar artery prenidal aneurysm measuring 7 x 8 x 4 mm with multiple small daughter lobules. This is better delineated in the three-dimensional reconstructions. Reflux of contrast into the  right vertebral artery was not achieved. The origin of PICA is normal unilaterally (we will defer to CTA for evaluation of the contralateral PICA). Given the flow demand from the arteriovenous malformation, the proximal branches of the basilar artery remains largely unopacified although do not appear to have any concerning features.   RIGHT SUPERIOR CEREBELLAR ARTERY, SUPERSELECTIVE RUN: Superselective injection of the right superior cerebellar artery distal to be prenidal aneurysm demonstrates partial opacification of the arteriovenous malformation. No normal brain parenchyma is visualized.  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST GLUE EMBOLIZATION): Following glue embolization of the branch of the right superior cerebellar artery supplying the arteriovenous malformation there remains filling of the superior cerebellar artery arteriovenous malformation from branches of the posterior cerebral arteries. However, there is significant contrast stagnation in the prenidal aneurysm in the right superior cerebellar artery. The branch of the right superior cerebellar artery originating proximal to the aneurysm remains patent and supplies normal brain parenchyma.  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-Coil EMBOLIZATION): Following coil embolization of the prenidal aneurysm, there is minimal residual filling at the base of the aneurysm. The branch of the right superior cerebellar artery originating proximal to the aneurysm remains patent and supplies normal brain parenchyma. There are no perfusion deficits to suggest distal emboli in the posterior circulation. There remains filling of the arteriovenous malformation from distal branches of the PCA.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE left vertebral artery:  3-D rotational angiography demonstrated a midline superior cerebellar AVM supplied primarily by branches of the right superior cerebellar artery and PCA collaterals. The nidus measures 2 x 2 cm. There is a large highly irregularly-shaped right superior cerebellar artery prenidal aneurysm measuring 7 x 8 x 4 mm with multiple small daughter lobules. There is a branch arising from the base of the aneurysm which appears to supply normal cerebellar tissue and a branch coming off the aneurysm itself which appears to travel directly to the AVM nidus.  XPER CT: post procedural XPER CT shows diffuse SAH, increased in conspicuity from preprocedural CT imaging. There is no ICH identified. There is however new IVH noted in the right lateral ventricle. Follow-up imaging is recommended.  COMPLICATIONS: Intraprocedural rupture of the prenidal aneurysm.  IMPRESSION: 1. Patient with a midline superior cerebellar arteriovenous malformation supplied primarily by branches of the right superior cerebellar artery and PCA collaterals. The AVM nidus measures 2 x 2 cm and drains predominantly into the right basal vein of Rosenthal and vein of Galen. There is a large highly irregularly-shaped right superior cerebellar artery prenidal aneurysm measuring 7 x 8 x 4 mm with multiple small bilateral lobules. This is believed to be the cause of the patient's underlying SAH rather than the AVM itself. The decision was made to proceed with embolization of the prenidal aneurysm with sacrifice of the branch of the superior cerebellar artery which appeared to lead directly to the arteriovenous malformation and is without significant filling of the normal brain parenchyma. This was done successfully with a glue embolization of the SCA branch distal to the aneurysm followed by coil embolization of the aneurysm itself. Following embolization, there was minimal residual filling at the base of the aneurysm with patency of the right SCA branch originating at the base of the aneurysm which supplied normal brain parenchyma. The AVM itself remains patent via filling from multiple branches off the PCA.  2. An XPER CT was performed at the conclusion of the procedure given increased in bloody drainage from the external ventricular drain which was placed prior to angiography. Increased conspicuity of the diffuse SAH was noted as well as new right lateral intraventricular hemorrhage. Follow-up imaging is recommended.   "}

Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, spinal cord infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography room and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 6 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 5000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. The ACT was checked to ensure that it was between 250-300. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was completed of the vessels listed above. Digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck.   The 5 French diagnostic catheter was exchanged for a 058 Navien guide catheter, the tip of which was situated in the distal cervical internal carotid artery. The Transform balloon catheter and mid petrous segment microguidewire were then advanced coaxially into the vertical petrous segment.  A new sterile drape was then placed over the patient's neck and chest, and the patient's hands were removed from under the drape and elevated over the bed in the anatomic position with the forearms and fingers extended. The timer was started and the balloon inflated. For the next 30 minutes, nearly continuous neurological testing was performed to assess comprehension, repetition, naming, calculation, finger recognition, gaze deviation, visual fields, right facial droop, right hemibody weakness, or right hemifacial\/hemibody sensory deficit. The extent of balloon inflation and balloon position were checked periodically during this time. The balloon remained occlusive within the petrous segment of the left internal carotid artery. Neurological deficits were not observed.   After balloon deflation and removal, a followup cerebral angiogram was performed from the guide catheter in the left internal carotid artery. Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was achieved with application of a Cardiva Vascade, followed by manual compression.

Transcatheter embolization using Yttrium-90 microspheres performed from: Left hepatic artery   IMPRESSION:   1. Successful bland embolization of the metastatic lesion with duodenal invasion using 100 um Embozene.  2. Successful Yttrium-90 Sirspheres left lobar radiotherapy for multifocal HCC.    TREATMENT PLAN:  1. Patient will return to clinic in 6-8 weeks with abdominal MRI and labs.  2. Access site precautions and orders placed.  TECHNIQUE:  With the patient in the supine position, the left wrist was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. The left wrist was evaluated with ultrasound and left radial artery patency and acceptable size criteria were documented and images were properly stored in PACS. A modified Allen test (Barbeau test Type B) was performed on the left wrist to confirm patency of the ulnopalmar arch using pulse oximetry.   1% lidocaine solution was administered for local anesthesia. Access was obtained to the left radial artery using a 21 gauge micro needle and ultrasound guidance. Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. Permanent recording and reporting of the saved image and study into the PACS system was performed. A wire was placed through the needle. A hydrophilic Glidesheath was advanced slowly over the wire. 3000 units of heparin, 200 mcg of nitroglycerin and 2.5 mg of verapamil was given through the arterial sheath with slow hemodilution. A side flush was started.   A 5-Fr [VENDOR] catheter was advanced over an 0.035\" wire into the abdominal aorta. The catheter was used to catheterize the visceral celiac artery. Angiograms and cone beam CT were performed to delineate the anatomy. Using the above microwire\/microcatheter system, the artery of the lesion invading the duodenum was catheterized, and additional cone beam CTs were performed. Bland embolization was performed as above.  The Trinav microcatheter was then exchanged for the truselect, which was used to catheterize the base of the left hepatic artery. Additional angiograms and cone beam CTs were performed demonstrating appropriate position for radial embolization.   Cone Beam CT (CBCT) was performed intraprocedurally for purposes of treatment planning, targeting and dose calculation. Axial and coronal images were created and 3D reconstruction was performed on a separate dedicated workstation under concurrent supervision.  Once the catheter was in adequate position, a pre-determined dose of 90-Yttrium radioactive particles was infused into the target hepatic artery. The microcatheter was flushed and the microcatheter was disposed of appropriately.   All catheters and wires were removed from the patient. [HCW] Band was placed on the left wrist for hemostasis. The access sheath was removed and no hematoma was seen. A radial artery pulse was confirmed distal to the puncture site confirming patent hemostasis.   The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition without any immediate postprocedural complications.

CTA revealed evidence of a right PICA aneurysm which is likely source of her subarachnoid hemorrhage. Additionally there is noted to be evidence of hydrocephalus on noncontrast CT scan. An external ventriculostomy drain was placed prior to her being brought for angiography. Diagnostic cerebral angiogram and treatment of ruptured aneurysm is indicated for prevention of recurrent rupture.   PROCEDURE: Cerebral angiogram, coil embolization of right posterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm.  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: 2 hours.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician.  He supervised the entire procedure. [HCW] and [HCW] were the fellows. Each actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS CATHETERIZED: Right internal carotid artery Left internal carotid artery Left vertebral artery Right vertebral artery Right posterior inferior cerebellar artery  VESSELS IMAGED: Right common femoral artery Right internal carotid artery Left internal carotid artery Left vertebral artery Right vertebral artery  VESSELS TREATED (in sequence): Right posterior inferior cerebellar artery  ANESTHESIA:   General Anesthesia administered by anesthesiology staff.  Pre- Intra- and post- anesthesia records are available in the patient chart.   MEDICATIONS GIVEN:  Heparin 5000 units IV Aspirin 300 mg PR Protamine 25 mg IV Ancef 2 gram IV  MATERIALS USED:  5 French micropuncture kit Cope mandrel wire 5 French transitional dilator 6 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 0.035\" Terumo exchange-length glidewire  5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter 6 French neuron guide catheter (95 cm) Headway 17 Advanced microcatheter Traxcess microguidewire Visipaque 320 contrast material (160 cc) Perclose ProGlide closure device  COILS: Optimax complex 4 mm x 13 cm   TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient and her family. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, hemorrhage, renal failure, limb loss, death, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.  After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion after intubation by the anesthesiology team. Additional shielding was placed in the pelvic region given the patient's young age. Access to the vascular system was gained by a single-wall puncture of the right common femoral artery with the aid of ultrasound guidance.  An angiogram of the right common femoral artery was obtained to confirm that the arterial puncture was above the bifurcation.  A 6 French short sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery  using Seldinger technique.  3000 units of heparin were administered. Using fluoroscopic guidance, the 5 French diagnostic catheter was used to select the bilateral internal carotid arteries and the bilateral vertebral arteries.  Digital angiograms were performed of these vessels, centered over the head. Ipsilateral and contralateral oblique projections were obtained of both internal carotid artery injections to evaluate for anterior communicating or MCA bifurcation aneurysms.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the mid cervical segment of the right internal carotid artery for better delineation of the intracranial vasculature. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the mid cervical segment of the left internal carotid artery for better delineation of the intracranial vasculature. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY: Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the distal V1 segment of the left vertebral artery for better delineation of the intracranial vasculature. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY: Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the V1 segment of the right vertebral artery for better delineation of the intracranial vasculature. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.  Following the diagnostic angiogram, an aspirin rectal suppository (300 mg) was administered in preparation for coiling. An additional 2000 units of heparin was administered IV. A CTs were evaluated and additional heparin boluses were given as needed in order to maintain an ACT level between 250 300.   The 5 French diagnostic catheter was then exchanged over the 0.038\" [VENDOR] exchange-length guidewire for the 053 neuron guide catheter, which was situated at the V3 segment of the left vertebral artery. Superselective catheterization of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm performed with the microcatheter over a microguidewire.   The aneurysm was framed and filled with the aforementioned coil using roadmap and blank roadmap technique.    A final cerebral angiogram was done in the AP and lateral projection to evaluate for residual filling, and distal emboli.  Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Ancef was administered.  Hemostasis was achieved by application of a Mynx closure device. A Tegaderm was then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: None.  FINDINGS:  RIGHT COMMON FEMORAL ARTERY: The arteriotomy is above the bifurcation of the right common femoral. The diameter of the vessel is somewhat small and therefore we used a Mynx closure device rather than Perclose device..  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified.    LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified.    LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No focal stenosis or early draining vein are identified. Reflux of contrast into the contralateral vertebral artery was achieved. There is an aneurysm at the origin of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery, which is better described on the right vertebral artery injections discussed below.  RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a bilobed aneurysm at the origin of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery, the dimensions of which are described on the 3-D rotational angiography discussed below. No focal stenosis or early draining vein are identified.   RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-EMBOLIZATION): Interval placement of coil into the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm. There is partial contrast stagnation within the aneurysm. There are no perfusion deficits to suggest distal emboli in the distal circulation.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated no evidence of aneurysm.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated no evidence of aneurysm.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated an aneurysm at the origin of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery which is not well visualized on this 3-D rotational angiogram, however is well visualized on the 3-D rotational angiogram of the right vertebral artery, which is described below..   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated a bilobed aneurysm of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery at the origin which measures 6.0 x 3.9 x 3.8 x 2.9 mm.   COMPLICATIONS: None.  IMPRESSION: 1. There is a bilobed aneurysm of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery at the origin which measures 6.0 x 3.9 x 3.8 x 2.9 mm. This is the source of patient's subarachnoid hemorrhage. 2. Successful coil embolization of the above aneurysm 3. No other aneurysms were visualized.   "}

Specifically, the risks of intracranial or systemic hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, distal emboli, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, device malfunction, groin hematoma, arterial dissection\/laceration, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite, intubated, and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery. An angiogram of the right common femoral artery was performed through the outer cannula the dilator sheath in order to confirm suitability of the arteriotomy. An 8 French sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery. These were advanced into the aortic arch and fluoroscopic guidance in the diagnostic catheter and Bentson guidewire were used to select the right internal carotid artery. The 8 French balloon guide-catheter was advanced into the right internal carotid artery as a system over the Bentson guidewire and selection catheter. The wire and diagnostic catheter were then removed and the balloon guide was connected to a continual heparinized saline flush. Digital angiograms were performed centered over the head.   The initial TICI score was 0 secondary to a right M1 occlusion.  A triaxial system of the aspiration catheter, microcatheter, and microguidewire were advanced into the internal carotid artery over roadmap guidance. The Trak 21 microcatheter and Asahi 018 microwire were then advanced through the aspiration catheter past the M1 occlusion. The aspiration catheter was then tracked to the face of the clot. The wire was removed from the microcatheter and replaced with the Trevo NXT 4 x 41 stentriever device.  The stentriever was deployed under fluoroscopy and the allowed to set in the clot for 5 minutes. The microcatheter was removed so that that the stentriever was \"naked\" in the aspiration catheter. The balloon on the guide catheter was then inflated. The stentriever was then removed under continuous aspiration using a 60cc syringe. Thrombus was  identified within the aspirate.  The balloon on the guide was deflated and a cerebral angiogram was performed through the guide catheter.

Request is made for conversion of the nontunneled to tunneled dialysis catheter. The patient presents with an indwelling right  internal jugular vein nontunneled catheter without complications at the entry site.   Procedure: After explaining the technique, risks, benefits, alternatives, and answering all questions, informed consent was obtained from the patient's daughter in presence of the patient. Timeout identifying the correct patient, procedure, site, allergies was performed and observed by the operating team. The patient was positioned supine. The procedure is performed under continuous physiologic monitoring. The patient received intravenous conscious sedation using Versed 0.5 mg and fentanyl 25 mcg.  The right   side of the lower neck and upper chest including the indwelling 13  F Trialysis  catheter was prepped with chlorhexidine followed by Betadine and draped in a sterile fashion. No evidence of inflammation\/infection at the entry site of the catheter is noted.   Following administration of local anesthesia using lidocaine 2% with epinephrine  10  ml at the right   side of the root of the neck extending to the right  infraclavicular region, 0.035\" guidewire was advanced through the existing catheter under fluoroscopy into the SVC. Through skin stab incision in the right  infraclavicular region, a 14F x 19  cm [tip to cuff] dialysis catheter was tunneled exiting at the root of the neck  at the exit of the nontunneled catheter. A peel-away sheath was advanced under fluoroscopy over the guidewire under fluoroscopy following intact removal of the nontunneled catheter [13 F x 15  cm]. Following removal of the guidewire and inner dilator, the catheter was advanced into the SVC and buried in the subcutaneous tissues following peeling of the sheath. Hemostasis was secured. The catheter tip was adjusted at the level of the SVC\/upper right atrium. Both ports demonstrated easy aspiration and injection and were flushed with hep saline per protocol. The incision at the root of the neck was closed with Steri-Strips. The catheter was anchored to the skin using Ethilon 2\/0 interrupted skin stitches. Sterile occlusive dressing was applied at the exit of the catheter in infraclavicular region. The patient tolerated to the procedure well. There were no intraprocedural complications. The patient was transferred to recovery in stable condition and eventually to the floor. The catheter is ready to use. Please also refer to the Procedure note placed in the patient's EPIC chart on the date of the procedure.  Fluoroscopy time: 00: 08.4 min.  Device implanted: Lot #[ID], Ref #[ID].

TECHNIQUE:  With the patient in the supine position, the left wrist was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. The left wrist was evaluated with ultrasound and appropriate left radial artery access criteria were documented. 1% lidocaine solution was administered for local anesthesia. Access was obtained to the left radial artery using a 21 gauge needle and ultrasound guidance. Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. Permanent recording and reporting of the saved image and study into the PACS system was performed. A wire was placed through the needle. A hydrophilic Glidesheath was advanced slowly over the wire. 3000 units of heparin, 200 mcg of nitroglycerin and 2.5 mg of verapamil was given through the arterial sheath with slow hemodilution. A 5-Fr Jacky\/Sarah catheter was advanced over an 0.035\" wire into the aorta. The catheter was exchanged for an Omniflush catheter for a pelvic aortogram. The Omniflush catheter was removed over the wire, but subsequent catheters could not be advanced due to vessel spasm. 50mcg nitroglycerin was administered at the site of presumed spasm, without resolution. All catheters and wires were removed from the patient. A band was placed on the left wrist for hemostasis. The access sheath was removed and no hematoma was seen. A radial artery pulse was confirmed distal to the puncture site confirming patent hemostasis.   Following standard prepping and draping, the left common femoral artery was punctured using a needle. Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. Permanent recording and reporting of the saved image and study into the PACS system was performed. An 0.035\" wire was advanced into the aorta. A vascular sheath was placed over the wire into the common femoral artery.

{"ReportID":7324131,"ContentText_DEID":"CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM AND ENDOVASCULAR PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION OF A RUPTURED, SUBTOTALLY COILED POSTERIOR COMMUNICATING ARTERY ORIGIN ICA ANEURYSM  CLINICAL INDICATION: [PATIENT] is a 33-year-old woman who was recently treated for a ruptured posterior communicating artery aneurysm. The aneurysm was subtotally coiled which is planned for \"plug and pipe\". She now presents for flow diversion of the residual aneurysm.  PROCEDURE: Cerebral angiogram and endovascular pipeline embolization.  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 60 minutes.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] was the fellow. Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS CATHETERIZED: Right internal carotid artery Right middle cerebral artery Right common femoral artery  VESSELS TREATED (in sequence): Right middle cerebral and internal carotid arteries  ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. Pre-, intra-, and post-anesthesia monitoring records are available in the chart.  MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine 10 cc SQ Heparin 5000 units IV Ancef 2 gram IV  MATERIALS:  5 French     micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 6 French 65cm Arrow sheath 0.038\" Bentson Guidewire 5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter 058 Navien guide catheter 3.75 mm x 14 mm pipeline embolization device 4.0 mm x 12 mm pipeline embolization device Phenom 27 Microcatheter Asahi 018 microguidewire Perclose ProGlide closure device Omnipaque-300 contrast (60 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, stent thrombosis\/stenosis, stent migration, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, non-target embolization, puncture site hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite, intubated, and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 6 French 65cm Arrow sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 5000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement; additional boluses of heparin were administered at one-hour intervals. The ACT was checked to ensure that it was between 250-300. Using fluoroscopic guidance,  the arteries  listed above were selectively catheterized. Digital angiograms were performed in the AP, lateral and oblique projections centered over the head and neck.   3D rotational angiography was performed with the diagnostic catheter in the right internal carotid artery to better delineate the intracranial anatomy. The acquisition was processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.   The diagnostic catheter was exchanged for a 058 Navien guide catheter under fluoroscopy and advanced into the petrous internal carotid. A working projection was obtained to best demonstrate the neck of the residual posterior communicating artery origin ICA aneurysm, as well as, the distal and proximal landing zones for the stent. Superselective catheterization of the right MCA was performed with the [VENDOR]om 27 microcatheter over the Asahi 018 microguidewire. The tip of the microguidewire was situated in the superior division of the M2.   The microguidewire was then exchanged for a 3.75 mm x 14 mm Pipeline embolization device. The device was deployed under fluoroscopic guidance and a single shot X-ray was performed to confirm that the  distal and proximal ends of the pipeline embolization device were in the proximal MCA and  cavernous carotid, respectively. Given that the morphology of the residual posterior communicating artery aneurysm hasn't substantially changed approximately one month following rupture I felt compelled to place a second device. Therefore a 4.0 mm x 12 mm pipeline embolization device was placed inside the first.  A final AP and Lateral angiogram were completed to evaluate the distal vasculature for perfusion deficits and emboli.   After completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. A roadmap of the right common femoral artery was obtained. The arteriotomy was above the level of the bifurcation and the CFA was of sufficient size to use the Perclose ProGlide closure device. Ancef was administered. The sheath was removed and hemostasis obtained using the Perclose ProGlide closure device. A Tegaderm were then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON:    .  FINDINGS:  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: Mild remaining mid segment and 1, A1, and supraclinoid ICA vasospasm are noted. Measurements of the three-dimensional rotational angiogram as compared to that from the original day demonstrated approximately 10-15% narrowing of these vessels. The superior apophyseal artery origin ICA aneurysm is grossly unchanged. The residual portion of the posterior communicating artery aneurysm at the neck has substantially expanded in size with a few lobule directed posteriorly.       RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION): The Pipeline device is well apposed to the vessel walls throughout it's course without endoleak. . Stasis of contrast is noted within the aneurysms.  No perfusion deficits to suggest distal emboli are present.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY: A 3D rotational angiogram of the  right internal carotid artery was completed and post-processed on an independent work station. 3D angiography revealed mild vasospasm was noted above and the aforementioned changes to the residual posterior communicating artery aneurysm.  RIGHT COMMON FEMORAL ARTERY: No abnormalities are detected. The arteriotomy was above the level of the bifurcation and the CFA was of sufficient size to use the Perclose ProGlide closure device.   COMPLICATIONS: none immediate.  IMPRESSION:  1. Potential change to the proximal portion of the subtotally coiled, ruptured, posterior communicating artery aneurysm. There is a posterior lead directed lobule measuring approximately 4 mm. The superior hypophyseal artery origin aneurysm is unchanged.  2. Successful deployment of scalloping pipeline embolization devices for treatment of the above-described aneurysms.        "}

Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   This was intended to be a middle meningeal artery embolization for primary treatment of mildly symptomatic subdural hematoma. However, a sphenoid branch made in anastomosis to the lacrimal gland. A separate, quite large sphenoid branch made direct anastomosis to the ethmoidal arcade supplying the nose. Considering the size of these branches in their ridge anastomoses, I felt embolization would result in a very high risk of postoperative blindness. Therefore, the procedure was aborted.  Following completion of the procedure, heparin was not reversed sitting the patient has a PE and had not Eliquis today. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Vascade followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Axial imaging.  FINDINGS: RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: The bifurcation is smooth, without irregularity, calcification, or stenosis with respect to the distal ICA. The ECA branches opacify normally.  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified.       RIGHT MIDDLE MENINGEAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: Normal anatomy. 2 large sphenoid branches are seen. One makes anastomoses to the lacrimal artery and gland whereas the others makes a retention anastomosis to the ethmoidal arteries.   COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION:  1. Diagnostic cerebral angiogram of the right internal\/external carotid arteries as well as middle meningeal artery. Middle meningeal artery embolization was aborted due to collateral study is which portends unjustifiably high risk of postprocedural blindness.     "}

Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, hemorrhage, renal failure, limb loss, death, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.  After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion after intubation by the anesthesiology team. Access to the vascular system was gained by a single-wall puncture of the right common femoral artery. A 6 French 65cm Arrow sheath was introduced into the descending aorta using Seldinger technique.  Using fluoroscopic guidance, the 5 French diagnostic catheter was used to select the bilateral internal carotid arteries and the right vertebral artery.  Digital angiograms were performed of these vessels, centered over the head. Ipsilateral and contralateral oblique projections were obtained of both internal carotid artery injections to evaluate for anterior communicating or MCA bifurcation aneurysms.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the right internal carotid artery for better delineation of the intracranial vasculature. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.  Following the diagnostic angiogram, an aspirin rectal suppository (300 mg) was administered in preparation for coiling. The 5 French diagnostic catheter was then exchanged over the 0.035\" [VENDOR]umo exchange-length glidewire for the 058 Navien guide catheter, which was situated at the right internal carotid artery. The balloon was then prepared on an adjacent table, and the microguidewire and the balloon were passed coaxially through the guide catheter into the right paraclinoid internal carotid artery. Superselective catheterization of the right posterior communicating artery aneurysm performed with the microcatheter over a microguidewire.   Using roadmap guidance, the balloon was advanced to cover the ostium of the aneurysm. The aneurysm was framed and filled with the aforementioned coils using both roadmap and blank roadmap technique.  A final cerebral angiogram was done in the AP and lateral projection to evaluate for residual filling, and distal emboli.  Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine.  An angiogram of the right common femoral artery was obtained to confirm that the arterial puncture was above the bifurcation that the vessels of adequate size to use a Perclose ProGlide. Ancef was administered.  Hemostasis was achieved by application of a Perclose ProGlide. A Tegaderm was then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: None.  FINDINGS:  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a 3.5 x 5 millimeter irregularly-shaped and inferiorly directed posterior communicating artery aneurysm. The posterior communicating artery itself is dominant and supplies the posterior cerebral artery territory. It arises from the base of this aneurysm. The aneurysm itself has a neck measuring 2.5 mm. The ACA and MCA and its branches are normal in course and caliber. There is normal cortical venous drainage.  RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY, CERVICAL: There is an irregularly-shaped calcified plaque just distal to the origin of the left internal carotid artery measuring up to 60% stenosis. The remainder of the left cervical ICA is unremarkable. The ECA branches opacify normally.  LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. The distal ICA and its segments are normal course and caliber. The left posterior communicating artery is dominant supplies the posterior cerebral territory. The ACA and MCA and its branches are normal course and caliber. There is normal cortical venous drainage.   LEFT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysms, or early draining vein are identified. The distal vertebral artery is normal in course and caliber. Reflux of contrast into the  contralateral vertebral artery was not achieved. The origin of PICA is normal unilaterally (we will defer to CTA for evaluation of the contralateral PICA). There is a duplicated SCA on the left. The basilar artery is unremarkable. The bilateral PCAs are patent with early contrast washout concordant with competitive flow from the posterior communicating arteries. There is normal cortical venous drainage.  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-EMBOLIZATION): There is minimal residual filling at the base of the coiled right posterior communicating artery aneurysm. The right posterior communicating artery is patent. There are no perfusion deficits to suggest distal emboli in the right internal carotid circulation.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE right internal carotid artery:  3-D rotational angiography demonstrated a highly irregular inferiorly directed right posterior communicating artery aneurysm measuring 3.5 x 5 mm in diameter. The right posterior communicating artery originates at the base of the aneurysm..   RIGHT COMMON FEMORAL ARTERY: The arteriotomy is above the bifurcation of the right common femoral artery and the diameter of the vessel is adequate for a Perclose ProGlide.  COMPLICATIONS: None.  IMPRESSION: 1. Successful coil embolization of a right posterior communicating artery aneurysm measuring 3.5 x 5 mm in diameter. There is minimal residual filling at the base of the aneurysm and the right posterior communicating artery is patent after coil embolization. No other aneurysms are visualized.   "}

Treatment Plan:   1.\tPatient will be admitted to ICU for overnight monitoring 2.\tPatient will be started on Lactulose\/rifaximin  Technique:   Following written informed consent, the patient was placed supine on the procedure table. After induction of general anesthesia, the right neck and abdomen were prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.   Access: The right neck was then evaluated with ultrasound. The skin overlying the right internal jugular vein was anesthetized with local, and a small dermatotomy was made.  Under ultrasound guidance a 21-gauge needle was advanced into the right internal jugular vein. A 0.018\" guidewire was advanced through the micropuncture needle. The needle was exchanged for a 5 French transitional catheter. The 0.018\" wire and inner dilator were removed, and a 0.035\" wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava.  The transitional catheter was exchanged for a sheath. An angled catheter was placed over the wire and used to select the right hepatic vein. A right hepatic venogram was obtained.   Notes on access catheter\/sheath combination: MPA\/10-Fr sheath  ICE (Intra-cardiac echo) technique: A second access site was obtained in the neck using ultrasound guidance and a vascular sheath. This sheath was guided using fluoroscopy into the hepatic venous confluence and utilized to advance the ICE. Real-time echo imaging was then utilized to target an appropriate portal radical, with attention paid to avoid traversal of critical intrahepatic vessels\/bile ducts and extrahepatic structures.  Pre-TIPS Pressures:  Right atrial and hepatic pressure measurements were obtained using a balloon catheter\/sheath, as detailed:  Right atrial: 13 mm Hg Wedged hepatic vein:  24 mm Hg Direct portal vein: 33 mm Hg  CO2 Portography: No  TIPS: Using the Argon ScorpionX TIPS set, the right portal vein was accessed, which was confirmed with the hand-injection of contrast. A 0.035\" wire was advanced into the portal vein and the TIPS sheaths were advanced over the wire into the portal vein. The inner sheath was removed and a marking pigtail catheter was advanced over the guidewire and used to measure the parenchymal tract and measure portal venous pressure. The sheath was ultimately advanced into the main portal vein, and a Viatorr stent was deployed within the TIPS shunt. The shunt was dilated throughout using a high pressure balloon. Follow-up portogram demonstrated good flow through the TIPS shunt with persistent portal vein peripheral thrombus and filling of two portosystemic collaterals. Thrombectomy was performed by advancing the Penumbra thrombectomy device through the TIPS stent over a wire into the main portal vein. 2 passes were made with the aspiration mode engaged. Venography demonstrated improvement in portal vein clot burden. The 2 two portosystemic collaterals were then accessed using a combination of angled 5 French catheter and microcatheter, and embolized using the following coils:   First collateral embolized: BALT PRESTIGE PLUS COMPLEX XTRA TREAD 12MMX65CM BALT PRESTIGE PLUS COMPLEX XTRA TREAD 12MMX65CM BALT PRESTIGE PLUS COMPLEX XTRA TREAD 12MMX45CM  Second collateral embolized: COIL RUBY COMPLEXSTD 12X60 COIL RUBY COMPLEXSTD 12X60  Post-TIPS Pressures: The pressures after shunt placement were recorded, as follows: Direct portal: 19 mm Hg Right atrial: 15 mmHg This corresponds to a portosystemic gradient of 4 mm Hg  At the end of the procedure the sheath was removed over a guidewire and a 12 French x 16 cm triple lumen catheter was placed. The catheter was flushed and heparinized per protocol. The catheter was sutured to the skin with 2-0 suture and a biodisc and sterile dressing were applied.

Right subclavian and right internal jugular sheaths left in place.  One wire left in place, within the right internal jugular sheath.  3. Left brachial venous access removed, with suture in place for hemostasis - to be removed by IR.   Technique:   The skin overlying the bilateral arm, chest, and neck access sites was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines). 2% lidocaine was infiltrated at all access sites before access.  The indwelling left internal jugular PermCath was removed over a wire and a sheath was advanced over the wire in its place.  Ultrasound evaluation of the left brachial vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle. An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance. A 10 French sheath was advanced over this wire.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle. An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire. The micropuncture set was first used to perform venography through the 5 French outer cannula and then a 0.035 inch stiff Glidewire was advanced through this access, projecting over the SVC, right atrium, and hepatic veins.  Venography was performed through the left brachial and right internal jugular vein access, demonstrating complete stenosis of the left brachiocephalic vein. The left brachiocephalic vein was dilated using a 10 mm x 4 cm Conquest balloon. Post-venoplasty venography demonstrated patency without extravasation. The left brachiocephalic vein was then dilated using a 12 mm x 4 cm Conquest balloon. Venoplasty was completed by inflating a 12 mm x 40mm Lutonix drug-eluting balloon at the site of stenosis for 3 minutes.  Post-venoplasty venography demonstrated excellent result with patent left brachiocephalic vein and good flow from left brachial access to the heart.  Over the previously placed right internal jugular access wire, serial dilators, a peel-away sheath, and finally a 15.5 French by 24 cm PermCath were advanced. The dilators and catheter advanced smoothly without difficulty. However, blood could not be aspirated from either lumen of the PermCath. Gentle contrast injection through this catheter demonstrated that the catheter tip was extravascular, within the right pleural space.

Abdominal pain and fevers with biliary obstruction.   PROCEDURES: 1. Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiogram 2. Internal\/External Biliary Drainage Catheter Placement 3. Percutaneous removal of occluded endoscopic common bile duct stent  FINDINGS:  A CT scan from [DATE] was reviewed  1. The scout radiograph shows a duodenal stent and a common bile duct stent. There are changes of dish in the lumbar spine. Contrast is present in the colon from recent CT scan. 2. Cholangiography shows   moderate dilation of the central bile ducts with an occluded endoscopic stent extending up into a central bile duct. 3. The left and right biliary ducts communicate. 4. A peripheral right bile duct was successfully punctured. An internal\/external biliary drain could not be advanced beyond the endoscopic stent. 5. The occluded stent was successfully snared and removed through the parenchymal tract. 6. A 12 French internal\/external biliary drain with extended sideholes has its cope loop in the duodenum (adjacent to the duodenal stent) with its side holes extending into the accessed right biliary duct.  IMPRESSION:  1. Moderate dilation of the central intrahepatic bile ducts with nondilated peripheral ducts and an occluded endoscopic stent extending to the duodenum. 2. Successful percutaneous retrieval of the occluded stent with placement of a 12 French internal\/external biliary drain.   TREATMENT PLAN:  The catheter should remain to gravity drainage. It will be capped as the bilirubin trends down.  Routine catheter exchange in 8 weeks. A viable stent could be placed at that time.   PROCEDURE:  Ultrasonographic evaluation was carried out. There is no significant intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. The anterior abdominal wall and right flank were prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  An appropriate skin entry site was identified using fluoroscopy and ultrasound, and anesthetized with local.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 22G Chiba needle was advanced into the liver and PTC performed in standard fashion.  A  bile duct was entered and the biliary system was opacified with contrast.  Cholangiographic images were obtained.  A suitable duct for drain placement was identified on the right. Under direct fluoroscopic guidance, a posterior right duct was accessed with a second 21-gauge AccuStick needle.  A 0.018\" wire was passed centrally, and the needle exchanged for a 6 French transitional catheter.  The inner stiffener, dilator, and guidewire were removed and contrast was injected to confirm location.  A 0.035\" glidewire and 4 French catheter were negotiated across the distal common bile duct obstruction into the small bowel. The glidewire was removed and contrast was injected to confirm location.  A 0.035\" Amplatz wire was placed through the catheter. A 12 French internal-external biliary drain was placed over the wire. It could not be advanced beyond the CBD, meeting obstruction near the mid portion of the occluded endoscopic stent. A long 7 French sheath was placed. A safety wire was advanced into the duodenum. The 7 French sheath was removed over both wires and replaced over the Glidewire.  A 15 mm ensnare was placed through the 7 French sheath and used to engage the upper portion of the stent. The stent and 7 French sheath were removed together at the flank, leaving the Amplatz wire in place as a safety measure.  The 12 French internal-external biliary drain was then easily advanced over the wire into the duodenum. The Cope loop was formed and locked in the duodenum. The side holes were positioned above the level of obstruction. Contrast was injected to confirm location. The catheter was secured to the skin with 2-0 Ethilon and attached to gravity drainage.  A sterile dressing was applied.  The procedure was well tolerated, and the patient discharged from the angiography suite still asleep into the care of anesthesiology for transfer to the PACU.

The left renal vein is normal in appearance. No significant reflux was visualized into the left gonadal vein. 2. The left common iliac, external iliac, and common femoral veins are unremarkable.  No collateral vessels were visualized. 3. There is long segment, smooth narrowing of the right common iliac and external iliac veins, with associated collateral flow and non-occlusive subacute-chronic clot.  The clot was successfully removed using a ClotTriever thrombectomy device.  IMPRESSION:   1. Successful left renal and bilateral iliofemoral venography\/IVUS with pertinent findings as above. 2. Successful right iliofemoral thrombectomy.  Follow up IVUS demonstrated no significant residual thrombus.  TREATMENT PLAN:  1. Patient will return to clinic in 4 weeks with follow up CTV to assess for any recurrent\/residual thrombus.  2. Patient will be started on low-dose Eliquis for DVT prophylaxis\/prevention of recurrent DVT.  Should patient redevelop DVT in the right iliofemoral system, recommend stent placement at the right common iliac vein.   3. Patient and family were advised on importance of adequate hydration and daily exercise.  TECHNIQUE:  With the patient in the supine position, the right neck was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. The right neck was punctured using a 21 gauge needle, and access was upsized in standard fashion using a transitional microdilator. A 0.035 Amplatz wire was advanced into the IVC and a 10 Fr, 40 cm sheath was placed.  A 5 Fr MPA catheter was used to select the left renal vein.  Venography was performed with findings as above.  Next, we turned our attention towards evaluation of the right common iliac and femoral veins.  The catheter and wire were advanced into the right common femoral vein.  The catheter was exchanged for a flush pigtail catheter and venography was performed with findings as above.  Next, IVUS was performed confirming nonocclusive thrombus throughout the right common iliac and external iliac veins.    We then turned our attention towards evaluation of the left common iliac and femoral veins.  The IVUS catheter was exchanged for an MPA catheter and the left common femoral vein was catheterized.  The catheter was exchange for a flush catheter and venography performed with findings as above.  Next, IVUS was performed demonstrating smooth long segment narrowing of the common iliac and external iliac veins, likely related to functional dehydration.  Given the presence of clinical (leg swelling) symptoms and iliofemoral thrombus, the decision was made to proceed with a right iliofemoral thrombectomy and heparinize the patient.  The patient was heparinized with target ACT of 230-250.  Due to concern of possible pulmonary emboli, decision was also made to proceed from a right lower extremity venous access.  The right groin and thigh were then prepped and draped in standard fashion.  Using ultrasound guidance, the right GSV was punctured using a 21 gauge needle and access upsized to an 0.035 system in standard fashion.  The access was sequentially dilated and a Inari ClotTriever sheath was then advanced.  The ClotTriever thrombectomy device was then inserted and two passes were made with successful removal of the right iliofemoral clot burden in its entirety.  This was confirmed with post-thrombectomy IVUS. Follow up venography was performed also confirming resolution of the previously visualized clot burden and non-filling of any collateral vessels.  No further intervention was warranted.  All sheath(s), catheters, and wires were removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition without any immediate postprocedural complications.

The patient received 4 units FFP for an INR of 2.0.   PROCEDURES: 1. Ultrasound guided access of a right anterior bile duct 2. Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiogram 3. Right Internal\/External Biliary Drainage Catheter Placement from a segment VI bile duct 4. Tract embolization from the initial access used for opacification 5. Ultrasound-guided access of the segment III bile duct 6. Placement of an 8 French external biliary drain into the left bile ducts  FINDINGS:  A CT scan from [DATE] and an MRI from [DATE] were reviewed  1. Cholangiography shows  severe central ductal dilation with a high-grade obstruction at the hilum. The left and right biliary ducts are isolated. 2. The 12 French internal\/external biliary drainage catheter has its cope loop in the duodenum and sideholes extending into the right biliary tree. 3. The initially accessed duct did not fill the right-sided biliary tree to the extent of the duct subsequently accessed for biliary drain placement. 4. The left-sided bile ducts are extremely dilated. A peripheral segment III duct was ultrasonographically dilated and needle entry images stored to PACS. 5. The central obstruction could not be traversed on the left and the external biliary drain has its cope loop in a left sided bile ducts centrally, just peripheral to the obstruction. 6. The cystic duct fills. The common bile duct is normal.  IMPRESSION:  1. High-grade hilar obstruction due to metastatic disease with isolated left and right biliary systems.. 2. Successful placement of 12 French internal\/external biliary drain via a peripheral right duct. 3. An external biliary drain was placed on the left as the central obstruction could not be traversed.  TREATMENT PLAN:  1. The catheters should remain to gravity drainage. The right internal\/external biliary drain can be capped as the bilirubin trends down. 2. The subxiphoid drain is external. An attempt at internalization can be made in 5-7 days. 3. Repeat CT is recommended after several days of drainage to ascertain the degree of hepatic drainage  achieved.   PROCEDURE:  Ultrasonographic evaluation was carried out. The anterior abdominal wall and right flank were prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion. Under direct ultrasound guidance, an anterior, relatively peripheral duct was punctured with a 21-gauge micropuncture needle. A 0.018 inch wire was passed centrally and the needle exchanged for a transitional dilator. Cholangiography was performed. Cholangiography suggested drainage would be improved with access to be slightly more cephalad bile duct. A long 6 French sheath was placed in the accessed duct and attention redirected to a second right-sided access.  A 21-gauge AccuStick needle was used to access a segment VI bile duct. A 6 French transitional dilator was placed. A 4 French catheter and Glidewire were used to negotiate into the duodenum. An Amplatz wire was placed.  Attention was redirected to the left. Under ultrasound guidance and with a 21-gauge micropuncture needle, a segment III bile duct was accessed. A 0.018 inch wire was placed, meeting resistance near the hilum. The needle was exchanged for a transitional dilator. Attempts were made at traversing the high-grade central obstruction with a 4 French angled catheter and Glidewire. The decision was made to place an external biliary drain. A short Amplatz wire was placed and the transitional dilator replaced with an 8 French locking pigtail catheter. The cope loop was formed and locked centrally and the catheter injected to confirm location. It was sutured in place and attached to gravity drainage. A Percu-Stay device was placed for improved security.  The segment VI access on the right was used to place a 12 French internal\/external biliary drainage catheter with extended sideholes. The cope loop was formed and locked in the duodenum and the sideholes extended into the peripheral right duct.  The long 6 French sheath in the more anterior ducts was withdrawn to just outside the duct. A Gelfoam plug was deployed to plug the tract.  The catheter was secured to the skin with 2-0 Ethilon and attached to gravity drainage.  A sterile dressing was applied.

Note is made of endoluminal thrombosis adjacent and superior to the endovenous entry site -increased density in a wavy geographic distribution, medial right upper lung, is known to represent this patient's intra-thoracic neoplasm and atelectasis  -on initial venography: complete occlusion of the origin of the superior vena cava (SVC), at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins.  Non-occlusive thrombosis is present at the very central aspect of the left brachiocephalic vein (LBCV) -post angioplasty: newly established, albeit irregular lumen of the mid SVC, albeit with mild superior extension of thrombotic disease  -on intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), minimal and maximal luminal diameter of the infra-stenotic, supra-atrial SVC: 11.4 and 17.6 mm, respectively  -stent deployed across the SVC, spanning from the inferior tip of the right brachiocephalic vein (RBCV) to the inferior aspect of the SVC, with excellent internal stent flow -post stent placement: complete mechanical thrombotic occlusion of the very central aspect of the LBCV -post mechanical thrombectomy: wide patency of the central LBCV, with excellent flow into the stent and SVC  -port catheter repositioned back to its normal intended through-the-stent position, with the distal catheter tip left at the superior cavoatrial junction.     Impression:   1.\tnon-occlusive thrombosis, RIJV, superior and adjacent to the venous entry of the right chest wall port catheter, with its distal tip at the superior cavoatrial jucntion 2.\tthrombotic occlusion of the confluence of both brachiocephalic veins 3.\tcatheter\/wire access gained across the occluded SVC 4.\tangioplasty of the SVC allowing for temporary change in the course and distal port catheter tip, within the RIJV (to allow stent placement) 5.\tSVC stenting, with brisk flow to the RA 6.\tfocal, thrombotic occlusion of the central LBCV, with successful treatment via mechanical thrombectomy, with resultant wide patency and brisk flow across the newly deployed stent and SVC   Treatment Plan:   The catheter tip is in good position. The line flushes and aspirates appropriately.  The catheter is okay to use.  Technique:   With the patient in the supine position, sterile technique and sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance were used to gain 21-needle access to the right (RIJV) and left (LIJV) internal jugular and common femoral (RCFV) veins using a 21-g needle.  Exchange was made over an 0.018-in Cope wire for a 5-Fr. introducer set.  This afforded exchange over an 0.035-in Rosen wire for an 9-Fr. x 26-cm introducer sheath via the LIJV; 8-Fr. sheath, RIJV; 9- then 10-Fr. long sheath via the RCFV.    RIJV Via the newly placed sheath, contrast examination was carried out.  A 5-Fr. angled catheter, over an 0.035-in glide wire, was then advanced to the point of thrombotic obstruction, immediately inferior to the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins.  The catheter-wire was made to probe this point, with successful passage into the SVC, then advancement into the right atrium (RA), then the inferior vena cava (IVC).    The RCFV sheath was then advanced to the superior aspect of the IVC, with an internal 20-mm snare wire.  This was used to catch and secure the wire from the RIJV access, an 0.035-in 260-cm Amplatz wire, with its distal tip externalized and with an accessible length outside of the patient.    Over the Amplatz wire, a 12-mm balloon catheter was advanced and used to dilate the SVC stenosis.  This was followed by repeat contrast evaluation.   Exchange was then made over the wire for an 8-Fr. IVUS ([VENDOR]) catheter.  This was used to interrogate the SVC, with identification of endoluminal thrombotic disease; superior and inferior extent of disease; minimal and maximal luminal diameters.   LIJV Via the sheath, a 5-Fr. angled catheter, over an 0.035-in glide wire, was advanced to the RA where, exchange was made over the Rosen wire for the 20-mm snare wire.  This was retracted, securing the inferior tip of the port catheter.  Both were retracted, with the distal tip of the catheter left in the lateral left brachiocephalic vein (LBCV).  Repeat contrast injection via the RIJV sheath shows some superior extension of the thrombotic disease, post SVC angioplasty, encompassing the BCV confluence.  This prompted the reposition of the distal port catheter tip from the LBCV to the inferior RIJV, using the snare wire via the RIJV approach.    RCFV Exchange was then made over the indwelling Amplatz wire for a Venovo 20-mm x 6-cm stent, deployed across the SVC, spanning from the inferior tip of the RBCV to the inferior aspect of the SVC.  The stent was then dilated to 18-mm using a balloon catheter.  This was followed by contrast examination.    Over the Amplatz wire, exchange was made from the indwelling LIJV sheath to a 12-Fr. size x 40-cm sheath, with the distal tip advanced to the peri-central LBCV.  Through the sheath, a 5-Fr. angled catheter was advanced, over an 0.035-in glide wire, through the stent, and into the IVC, where exchange was made for an 0.035-in Amplatz wire.  Over this, a 12-Fr. Penumbra CAT-12 device was advanced, with the distal tip left adjacent to the newly deployed SVC stent.  The device was used for mechanical thrombectomy, with two passes made across the very short distance of thrombotic disease, yielding a small number of thrombotic clumps.  The device was then removed, with subsequent contrast examination performed.    With the port catheter having remained secured to the snare wire, both were then advanced inferiorly, into the newly deployed stent, with the distal catheter tip left at the superior cavoatrial junction.    Upon completion, all access devices were removed and manual compression was applied to effect hemostasis.    The patient tolerated the procedure well.

MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Heparin 4000 units IV Protamine 20 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.035\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Boston Scientific sheath 5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter  5 French Simmons 3 glide catheter Mynx Closure Device Visipaque-270 contrast material (60 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 4000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the R ICA for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the L ICA for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the L vertebral artery for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Mynx closure device followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Cerebral angiogram [DATE].  FINDINGS: RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No definite aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified.  There is a small outpouching at the site of the posterior communicating artery, which does not meet strict infundibulum criteria as it is not exactly pyramidal shaped. This is better seen on the 3-D angiogram below.  LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified.   LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Reflux of contrast into the  contralateral vertebral artery was achieved. The origin of PICA is normal bilaterally.   LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY, CERVICAL: There is a critical stenosis at the origin of the external carotid artery. There is an irregular calcified plaque at the origin of the left internal carotid artery resulting in approximately 75% carotid artery stenosis by NASCET criteria. The distal common carotid artery and cervical internal carotid artery are normal in caliber.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated a small outpouching at the origin of the posterior communicating artery which does not meet strict infundibulum criteria due to its shape.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated no definite aneurysms.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated no definite aneurysms.   COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of aneurysms or other vascular malformations that would explain patient's previous subarachnoid hemorrhage was identified on this angiogram. 2. Approximately 75% stenosis of the proximal left internal carotid artery, stable from prior. 3. Small outpouching at the site of the origin of the right posterior communicating artery, which may represent an infundibulum, though this does not meet strict infundibulum criteria based on shape. Attention on follow-up imaging. 4. Critical stenosis of the left external carotid artery origin. 5. Bovine-type arch requiring the use of a reverse curve catheter to catheterize the left common carotid artery.

Following embolization, no new leakage seen. 2.\tUneventful image guided replacement of the biliary catheter as described. Prior biliary catheter was noted to have migrated peripherally (radiopaque marker slightly peripheral). New catheter in optimal position.  Treatment Plan:   1. Patient to return in 8-12 weeks for exchange of internal\/exchange biliary catheter if no changes or issues are present. 2. Know percutaneous cholecystostomy drain to remain in position for at least 6 weeks since placement to allow for tract maturation.  3. Biloma drain to remain in place to ensure comprehensive drainage now in the setting of sealing of area of leak.  Technique:   The existing catheter and surrounding soft tissues were prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Local anesthetic was injected at the catheter entry site. Contrast was injected into the existing biliary catheter.  An 0.035\" wire was negotiated through the catheter into the small bowel. The catheter was removed and exchanged for a 9 French sheath. Via a 4F Kumpe, the 0.035\" wire was exchanged for an 0.035\" Rosen wire, used as a buddy\/safety wire in the small bowel. The Kumpe was removed and then placed in parallel to the existing wire. The Kumpe and a Glidewire Advantage were negotiated into the segment 2 biliary duct. A glidewire was then carefully advanced across the area of bile leak\/fistula. The Kumpe was advanced and the wire was removed. A 130cm 2.4 Progreat microcatheter and 0.014\" Runthrough wire were advanced into the duct peripheral to the area of bile leak\/fistula. The wire was removed. A discussion was held regarding embolic\/sealant options. Given the configuration of the area of leak, a decision was made to use thick liquid embolic (due to concern for coil prolapse into the biloma cavity). Given the concern for adhesion to the microcatheter and need for a thick, study liquid embolic, a decision was made to use a cohesive embolic. 0.5 ml Obsidio Comformable Embolic (a shear-thinning embolic) was used and carefully injected to ensure sufficient scaffolding both peripheral and central to the area of bile leak\/fistula. The microcatheter was removed. Cholangiogram confirmed successful exclusion of the leak. The catheter was then removed.  The sheath was removed and a new 10.2 French internal\/external biliary drain with extended sideholes was placed over the wire. Contrast was injected to confirm tube position. The catheter was secured to the skin with 2-0 Prolene. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.  The procedure was well tolerated, and the patient discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.

Treatment Plan:   1.\tPatient will be admitted to ICU for overnight monitoring  Technique:   Following written informed consent, the patient was placed supine on the procedure table. After induction of general anesthesia, the right neck and abdomen were prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.   Access: The right neck was then evaluated with ultrasound. The skin overlying the right internal jugular vein was anesthetized with local, and a small dermatotomy was made.  Under ultrasound guidance a 21-gauge needle was advanced into the right internal jugular vein. A 0.018\" guidewire was advanced through the micropuncture needle. The needle was exchanged for a 5 French transitional catheter. The 0.018\" wire and inner dilator were removed, and a 0.035\" wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava.  The transitional catheter was exchanged for a sheath. An angled catheter was placed over the wire and used to select the right hepatic vein. A right hepatic venogram was obtained.   Notes on access catheter\/sheath combination: Glidewire Advantage, MPA beacon, 10-Fr sheath  ICE (Intra-cardiac echo) technique: A second access site was obtained in the neck using ultrasound guidance and a vascular sheath. This sheath was guided using fluoroscopy into the hepatic venous confluence and utilized to advance the ICE. Real-time echo imaging was then utilized to target an appropriate portal radical, with attention paid to avoid traversal of critical intrahepatic vessels\/bile ducts and extrahepatic structures.  Pre-TIPS Pressures:  Right atrial and hepatic pressure measurements were obtained using a balloon catheter\/sheath, as detailed:  Free hepatic vein: 13 mm Hg Right atrial: 9 mm Hg  CO2 Portography: No  TIPS: Using the Argon ScorpionX TIPS set, the right portal vein was accessed, which was confirmed with the hand-injection of contrast. A 0.035\" Rosen wire was advanced into the portal vein and the TIPS sheaths were advanced over the wire into the portal vein. The inner sheath was removed and a marking pigtail catheter was advanced over the guidewire and used to measure the parenchymal tract and measure portal venous pressure. The sheath was ultimately advanced into the main portal vein, and a Viatorr stent was deployed within the TIPS shunt. The shunt was dilated throughout using an 8 mm high pressure balloon. Follow-up portogram demonstrated good flow through the TIPS shunt. Direct portal vein pressure: 23 mm Hg Pre-TIPSS portosystemic gradient: 14 mm Hg  Post-TIPS Pressures: The pressures after shunt placement were recorded, as follows: Direct portal: 20 mm Hg Right atrial: 16 mmHg This corresponds to a portosystemic gradient of 4 mm Hg  At the end of the procedure the sheath was removed over a guidewire and a 12 French x 16 cm triple lumen catheter was placed. The catheter was flushed and heparinized per protocol. The catheter was sutured to the skin with 2-0 suture and a biodisc and sterile dressing were applied.

{"ReportID":7403236,"ContentText_DEID":"DIAGNOSTIC CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM  CLINICAL INDICATION: This is a 29 years Female who presents for diagnostic cerebral angiography following CTA with concern for underlying arteriovenous malformation.   PROCEDURE: Diagnostic cerebral angiogram.  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 60 minutes.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] and [HCW] were the fellows. Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right Internal Carotid Artery Right External Carotid Artery Left Internal Carotid Artery Left External Carotid Artery Left Vertebral Artery Right Vertebral Artery   ANESTHESIA: Local in the right groin with bupivacaine. Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by the nurse present during the entire procedure. The patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Sedation was administered by a specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for the duration of the procedure as outlined above (Total intra service time, 60min). Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.   MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Versed 1 mg IV Fentanyl 50 mcg IV Heparin 3000 units IV Protamine 20 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 5 French Vertebral catheter  Mynx Closure device Visipaque-270 contrast material (120 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the right vertebral artery for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Vascade followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Noninvasive imaging.  FINDINGS:  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. The distal internal carotid artery and its segments are normal in course and caliber. The ACA and MCA and its branches are normal course and caliber. There is normal cortical venous drainage.   RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a right cerebellar arteriovenous malformation supplied by branches of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery anterior inferior cerebellar artery, and superior cerebellar arteries. The AVM drains primarily via markedly ectatic cerebellar cortical veins into the right sigmoid and jugular veins. There is an additional cortical vein which traverses midline and drains into the left sigmoid sinus. There there are 2 small intranidal aneurysms off of the superior cerebellar artery, the larger is bilobed in appearance and measures 4 x 4 mm and the smaller is located just proximally and measures 2.5 x 2 mm. Reflux of contrast into the contralateral vertebral artery was not achieved. There is a duplicated left SCA. The bilateral PCAs are patent and unremarkable in appearance.  LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY, CERVICAL: The bifurcation is smooth, without irregularity, calcification, or stenosis with respect to the distal ICA. The ECA branches opacify normally.  LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. The distal internal carotid artery and its segments are normal course and caliber. The ACA and MCA and its branches are normal course and caliber. There is normal cortical venous drainage.   LEFT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.    LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is redemonstration of the right cerebellar arteriovenous malformation as described in the right vertebral artery injection. The left posterior inferior cerebellar artery is unremarkable. Reflux of contrast into the contralateral vertebral artery was not achieved. There is early washout of contrast in the distal basilar artery, likely the result of washout from the contralateral vertebral artery.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated the right cerebellar arteriovenous malformation supplied primarily by the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery, anterior inferior cerebellar artery, and superior cerebellar artery. There are multiple intranidal aneurysms on the SCA feeders, the smallest located more proximally and measuring 2.5 x 2 mm and the more distal aneurysm bilobed in appearance measuring 4 mm x 4 mm with a smaller 2 mm lobule.  COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: There is a right cerebellar arteriovenous malformation supplied primarily by the right posterior inferior cerebral artery, anterior inferior cerebellar artery, and right superior cerebellar artery. There are multiple intracranial aneurysms on the SCA, the smallest of which is located more proximally measures 2.5 x 2 mm and the larger measuring 4 x 4 mm with a smaller 2 mm lobule. Local mass effect from this intranidal aneurysm may be responsible for the pa[HCW]'s observed clinical facial palsy given its location in relation to the brainstem."}

Exchange was made over an 0.018-in Cope wire for a 5-Fr. micropuncture set.  This afforded exchange over 0.035-in Rosen wire for a 9-Fr. dilator, then a 10-Fr. 40-cm angled introducer sheath (a).  Through this, a 5-Fr. MPA catheter was advanced, over an 0.035-in glide wire, used to catheterize the right HV, with the outer sheath tip left at the HV confluence.  The catheter was advanced to the parenchymal level, where a wedged pressure measurement was obtained.  Free HV pressure was measured via the sheath.  Wedge hepatogram was performed using carbon dioxide.   Exchange was them over the Rosen wire for a Colapinto needle.  This was used to attempt to gain access to the right or confluent PV system, with no avail.  Two other PV system accesses were eventually abandoned: no inflow vessel could be found from access to a mid liver PV branch; exaggerated turn\/angulation of a segment 5 PV branch did not allow necessary instrumentation despite the use of Amplatz and Meier wires through to the SV and SMV  Sterile technique and sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance were used to gain 21-g needle access to the RIJV, approximately 2 cm superior to the above.  Exchange was made over an 0.018-in Cope wire for a 5-Fr. micropuncture set.  This afforded exchange over 0.035-in Rosen wire for a 9-Fr. dilator, then a 10-Fr. 40-cm angled introducer sheath (b), with the distal tip advanced to the peri-hepatic inferior vena cava (IVC).  Through this, an 8-Fr. intra-cardiac echocardiogram (ICE) catheter was inserted, used to interrogate the right liver.  Findings are listed above.  Of note is the revelation that the middle HV is the best (and only conventional) target source to the PV system.    Through sheath (a), a 5-Fr. angled catheter, over an 0.035-in glide wire, was used to catheterize the middle HV (mHV).  Exchange was then made over an 0.035-in Amplatz wire for the Colapinto needle.  This, with ICE guidance, was used to access the confluent aspect of the main PV.  Over an 0.035-in GWA wire, exchange was made for a 5-Fr. angled glide catheter, with the distal tip advanced to the mid SV, where contrast examination was carried out.    The intrahepatic tract was then dilated using an 8-mm balloon catheter.  Exchange was then made over an 0.035-in Meier wire for a 12-Fr. introducer sheath.  While keeping wire access to the SV, a CAT-12 Penumbra aspiration thrombectomy catheter was inserted and used to probe the central SV and main PV.  Repeat contrast examination shows no significant change.  This prompted exchange over the Meier wire for a 16-Fr. introducer sheath.  Through this, a Lightning Flash thrombectomy catheter was advanced, used to perform aspiration thrombectomy in the central SV and main PV.  Completion, repeat venogram shows some improvement, with mild diminution of the endoluminal clot burden.    Exchange was then made over the Meier wire for the 10-Fr. sheath.  Through this, an 8-10-mm x 6 cm Controlled Expansion Viatorr stent was inserted, deployed across the transhepatic tract, with its inferior tip rested in the superior main PV and its superior tip, at the junction of the HV confluence and the IVC.  The newly deployed stent was dilated using the 8-mm balloon catheter.  Exchange was then made over the same wire for 5-Fr. straight flush catheter, with its distal tip left in the SV, where contrast examination was performed.  Repeat pressure measurement was performed via the same catheter and via the outer sheath, at the hepatocaval venous junction.    Upon completion, exchange from the indwelling accesses devices was made over the Rosen wire for a 12-Fr. triple-lumen central venous catheter, with the distal tip left at the superior cavoatrial junction.  The catheter was secured in place using 2-0 Prolene suturing to the skin.  Each lumen was flushed using heparinized saline.    The patient tolerated the procedure well.

{"ReportID":7403290,"ContentText_DEID":"DIAGNOSTIC CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM  CLINICAL INDICATION: This is a 63 years Female who presents for diagnostic cerebral angiography to evaluate for underlying right MCA bifurcation aneurysm.   PROCEDURE: Diagnostic cerebral angiogram.  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 45 minutes.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] and [HCW] were the fellows. Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right Internal Carotid Artery Right External Carotid Artery Left Internal Carotid Artery Left External Carotid Artery Left Vertebral Artery   ANESTHESIA: Local in the right groin with bupivacaine. Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by the nurse present during the entire procedure. The patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Sedation was administered by a specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for the duration of the procedure as outlined above (Total intra service time, 45min ). Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Versed 1 mg IV Fentanyl 50 mcg IV Heparin 3000 units IV Protamine 20 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter  Cardiva Vascade Visipaque-270 contrast material (120 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the right internal carotid artery for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Vascade followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Noninvasive imaging.  FINDINGS: RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a laterally projecting right MCA bifurcation aneurysm measuring 8.5 x 7.5 mm with a 6 mm neck without irregular features. The ICA and its segments are normal course and caliber. The ACA and its branches are normal course and caliber. There is normal cortical venous drainage.  RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. The distal left internal carotid artery is normal in course and caliber. The left posterior communicating artery is dominant supplies the posterior cerebral territory. The ACA and MCA and its branches are normal course and caliber. There is normal cortical venous drainage.   LEFT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Reflux of contrast into the contralateral vertebral artery was achieved. The origin of PICA is normal bilaterally. The basilar artery and its branches are normal course and caliber. The left P1 segment of the PCA is hypoplastic with early contrast washout of the PCA territory. This is consistent with the dominant left posterior communicating artery visualized on the left internal carotid injection.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated a laterally projecting right MCA bifurcation artery aneurysm measuring 8.5 mm x 8 mm x 7 mm with a 6 mm neck. The M2 branches of the right MCA originate the base of the aneurysm.  COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: There is a laterally projecting right MCA bifurcation artery aneurysm measuring 8.5 x 8 x 7 mm with a 6 mm neck. The M2 branches originate the base of this aneurysm.

Impression:   1.\tTechnically successful insertion of 15,5 French  tunneled abdominal ascites drain.  Difficulty was encountered advancing the catheter across the abdominal midline due to multiloculated nature of the ascites and numerous bowel adhesions along the anterior abdominal wall.  Treatment Plan:   The catheter may be used immediately.      Technique:   Informed consent for the procedure was obtained, and time-out was performed prior to the procedure.  The skin overlying the access site was subsequently prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).   The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right lower quadrant were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the abdomen was performed demonstrating small volume ascites.  Under ultrasound guidance, peritoneal space was accessed with a 5 French angiocath needle.  Multiple attempts were made at advancing a wire across the abdominal midline in conjunction with a standard angled catheter. However, these attempts were unsuccessful. Next, approximately 1 L of normal saline was filled through the catheter to artificially distended peritoneal cavity to allow for easier wire passage. However, this was also ultimately unsuccessful. We then turned our attention towards identifying a suitable pocket of ascites along the left hemiabdomen. A small pocket was identified sonographically and local anesthetic was administered at the overlying skin. Next, the peritoneal was accessed under continuous ultrasound guidance using a 5 French Angiocath needle.   Similar to the right hemiabdomen, difficulty was encountered passing a wire across the abdominal midline due to numerous bowel adhesions along the anterior abdominal wall and resultant multiloculated nature of the ascites.  The decision was made to proceed forward with drain placement as her underlying prognosis was poor, her adhesions would only worsen with increased metastatic spread disease, and palliative intent of the procedure.  Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the upper anterior abdomen to the dermatotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the dermatotomy site.  The peritoneal access site was dilated to allow introduction of a peel-away sheath.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  Static fluoroscopic image was obtained documenting the catheter tip over the left, upper abdomen. The dermatotomy site was closed with a resorbable suture and Dermabond.

Difficulty was encountered advancing the catheter across the abdominal midline due to multiloculated nature of the ascites and numerous bowel adhesions along the anterior abdominal wall.  Treatment Plan:   The catheter may be used immediately.      Technique:   Informed consent for the procedure was obtained, and time-out was performed prior to the procedure.  The skin overlying the access site was subsequently prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).   The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right lower quadrant were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the abdomen was performed demonstrating small volume ascites.  Under ultrasound guidance, peritoneal space was accessed with a 5 French angiocath needle.  Multiple attempts were made at advancing a wire across the abdominal midline in conjunction with a standard angled catheter. However, these attempts were unsuccessful. Next, approximately 1 L of normal saline was filled through the catheter to artificially distended peritoneal cavity to allow for easier wire passage. However, this was also ultimately unsuccessful. We then turned our attention towards identifying a suitable pocket of ascites along the left hemiabdomen. A small pocket was identified sonographically and local anesthetic was administered at the overlying skin. Next, the peritoneal was accessed under continuous ultrasound guidance using a 5 French Angiocath needle.   Similar to the right hemiabdomen, difficulty was encountered passing a wire across the abdominal midline due to numerous bowel adhesions along the anterior abdominal wall and resultant multiloculated nature of the ascites.  The decision was made to proceed forward with drain placement as her underlying prognosis was poor, her adhesions would only worsen with increased metastatic spread disease, and palliative intent of the procedure.  Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the upper anterior abdomen to the dermatotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the dermatotomy site.  The peritoneal access site was dilated to allow introduction of a peel-away sheath.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  Static fluoroscopic image was obtained documenting the catheter tip over the left, upper abdomen. The dermatotomy site was closed with a resorbable suture and Dermabond.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.   The catheter was connected to suction and 1.5 liters of clear, yellow fluid was drained from the peritoneal cavity. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate post procedural complication.

Treatment Plan:  Follow up pathology results.  Technique:   The procedure, options, and risks were reviewed with patient, including bleeding, infection, and pneumothorax. A time out was performed before initiating the procedure.  The skin overlying the access site was subsequently prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines). Patient sedation was performed, as detailed below.  The left neck was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Using local anesthetic and ultrasound guidance, the left internal jugular vein was punctured with a 21 gauge needle with permanent reporting and recording. An image documenting vein patency and needle entry was stored and transferred to PACS.   Using a 0.035 inch Glidewire advantage and Simmons 1 glide catheter, and the hepatic vein confluence was easily catheterized, however the catheter would not advance over the wire for stable access within the hepatic veins. We attempted to exchange the catheter off the wire, however the wire would buckle out of the veins back into the IVC.   A 10 French by 45 cm TIPS sheath was then advanced into the IVC for increased stability. A multitude of different diagnostic catheters and wires (Rosen wire, stiff Glidewire, standard Simmons 1 catheter, Cobra C2 glide catheter, MPA catheter) were used in attempts to catheterize the right hepatic vein. Ultimately the Simmons glide catheter and stiff Glidewire were able to select the right hepatic vein. With stable access in the hepatic vein, the wire was exchanged for an Amplatz superstiff. The Simmons catheter was then exchanged for an MPA catheter and the sheath was advanced into the hepatic vein confluence.  Using the MPA catheter, a wedged hepatic pressure and free hepatic pressure were obtained.  The Amplatz wire was reintroduced, and the biopsy cannula was advanced over the wire through the sheath into the hepatic veins. The wire was removed, and 4 passes made with the 19 gauge coaxial needle.  The specimen was placed in formalin and delivered to the laboratory.  The cannula and sheath were removed and hemostasis achieved with manual compression.

Successful ExperGuide fluoroscopy guided targeted liver biopsy of the segment 4A\/8 hepatic dome lesion. No pneumothorax on post biopsy CT scan.  TREATMENT PLAN:  1. Patient will return to clinic in 6-8 weeks with abdominal MRI and labs.  2. Follow-up pathology results from biopsy. 3. Access site precautions and orders placed.  TECHNIQUE:  With the patient in the supine position, the left wrist was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. The left wrist was evaluated with ultrasound and left radial artery patency and acceptable size criteria were documented and images were properly stored in PACS. A modified Allen test (Barbeau test Type B) was performed on the left wrist to confirm patency of the ulnopalmar arch using pulse oximetry.   Access was obtained to the left radial artery using a 21 gauge micro needle and ultrasound guidance. Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. Permanent recording and reporting of the saved image and study into the PACS system was performed. A wire was placed through the needle. A hydrophilic Glidesheath was advanced slowly over the wire. 3000 units of heparin, 200mcg of nitroglycerin and 2.5mg of verapamil was given through the arterial sheath with slow hemodilution. A side flush was started.   A 5-Fr [VENDOR] catheter was advanced over an 0.035\" Bentson wire into the abdominal aorta. The catheter was used to catheterize the superior mesenteric artery, and initial angiogram carried out to the portal venous phase demonstrated no variant hepatic arterial anatomy, as well as patent portal venous flow. Additional note was made of a large gastroesophageal varix. Catheter was then used to select the celiac artery. The above microcatheter system was used to catheterize the middle hepatic artery supplying the segment 4A\/8 lesion.    Biopsy:  Ultrasound evaluation of the upper abdomen was performed, and the suspect hepatic dome lesion was thought to be visualized. The biopsy introducer was advanced to this lesion, however when corresponding with fluoroscopy, as determined that this was likely the segment 4 lesion, not the hepatic dome lesion to be targeted for biopsy. A cone beam CT was performed, and [VENDOR]guide technology was used for fluoroscopic guidance to target the lesion. Under direct fluoroscopic visualization, an additional biopsy introducer was advanced into the inferior margin of the lesion, and 2 18-gauge core biopsies were obtained, placed in formalin, and delivered to the pathology lab. (The introducer needles were kept in place until after chemoembolization was performed. Gelfoam slurry was used to tract embolize both needle paths)   TACE:  The above drug-eluting chemotherapy beads were then used to embolize the hepatic dome segment 4A\/8 lesion. Attention was then turned to catheterize the segment 4B lesion. The above microcatheter system was used to select the segment IVb artery arising from the left hepatic artery, chemotherapy embolization was performed as above. A cone beam CT demonstrated some concern for incomplete coverage, so segment 5 hepatic artery was catheterized and subsequently embolized as above.     Completion: Beam CT demonstrated no pneumothorax from the hepatic dome biopsy, as well as contrast staining in the 2 target lesions from chemoembolization.   All catheters and wires were removed from the patient. A TR Band was placed on the left wrist for hemostasis. The access sheath was removed and no hematoma was seen. A radial artery pulse was confirmed distal to the puncture site confirming patent hemostasis.   The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition without any immediate postprocedural complications.  Cone Beam CT (CBCT) was performed intraprocedurally for purposes of treatment planning, targeting and dose calculation. Axial and coronal images were created and 3D reconstruction was performed on a separate dedicated workstation under concurrent supervision.

This was extended on the hepatic venous and with an additional 8-10 mm x 4 cm x 2 cm controlled expansion Viatorr stent (ballooned to 10 mm). 2.\tThe portosystemic gradient was reduced from 26 mm Hg to 12 mmHg.  Treatment Plan:   1.\tPatient will be admitted to ICU for overnight monitoring 2.\tPatient will be started on Lactulose\/rifaximin  Technique:   Following written informed consent, the patient was placed supine on the procedure table. After induction of general anesthesia, the right neck and abdomen were prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.   Access: Hepatic venous:  The right neck was then evaluated with ultrasound. The skin overlying the right internal jugular vein was anesthetized with local, and a small dermatotomy was made.  Under ultrasound guidance a 21-gauge needle was advanced into the right internal jugular vein. A 0.018\" guidewire was advanced through the micropuncture needle. The needle was exchanged for a 5 French transitional catheter. The 0.018\" wire and inner dilator were removed, and a 0.035\" Amplatz wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava.  The transitional catheter was exchanged for a 10 French angled sheath. An angled catheter was placed adjacent to the wire and used to select the right hepatic vein. A right hepatic venogram was obtained.   Notes on access catheter\/sheath combination: MPA\/10-Fr sheath  Portal: Initially a recannulized umbilical vein was attempted to be accessed using a micropuncture kit. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, however would not track to the main portal vein. Additional access was attempted as the umbilical vein dives through the falciform ligament, however the same issues were encountered.  Ultimately the decision was made to obtain direct portal access. Under real-time ultrasound guidance, a peripheral right portal vein was accessed using a 21-gauge Chiba needle. The 0.018 inch wire was then advanced centrally, down the right main portal vein, through the portal vein and into the splenic vein. With stable access into the portal system, a 5 French sheath was advanced into the peripheral portal access, and a SOS2 catheter was advanced to the right main portal vein as a target. Portal venogram and direct portal pressures were obtained (see below).  Pre-TIPS Pressures:  Right atrial and hepatic pressure measurements were obtained using a balloon catheter\/sheath, as detailed:  Direct portal: 36 mmHg  Right atrial: 10 mm Hg  TIPS:  Using the Ring TIPS set, the right portal vein was accessed, using the SOS2 catheter as a target, which was confirmed with the hand-injection of contrast. A 0.035\" Glidewire was advanced into the portal vein and the TIPS sheaths were advanced over the wire into the portal vein. The inner sheath was removed and a marking pigtail catheter was advanced over the guidewire and used to measure the parenchymal tract and measure portal venous pressure. The sheath was ultimately advanced into the main portal vein, and the above Viatorr stent was deployed within the TIPS shunt. The shunt was dilated throughout using a high pressure balloon up to 10 mm. Follow-up portogram demonstrated good flow through the TIPS shunt with minimal filling of collaterals.   Injection of the neck sheath positioned at the hepatic confluence demonstrated appropriate positioning of the TIPS, however the decision was made to extend the TIPS towards the hepatic venous end with a second Viatorr.  Post-TIPS Pressures: The pressures after shunt placement were recorded, as follows: Direct portal: 24 mm Hg Mid TIPS: 21 mmHg Right atrial: 12 mmHg This corresponds to a portosystemic gradient of 12 mm Hg  At the end of the procedure the sheath was removed over a guidewire and a 12 French x 16 cm triple lumen catheter was placed. The catheter was flushed and heparinized per protocol. The catheter was sutured to the skin with 2-0 suture and a biodisc and sterile dressing were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.  Portal access closure: Through the transhepatic 5 French sheath, a single Nester coil was deployed for closure. However upon removal of the sheath, anesthesiology commented that the patient's pressor requirements had increased. Immediate ultrasound evaluation of the abdomen was performed without any significant expansion of the minimal ascites present. A paracentesis was performed, using a 5 French [VENDOR]eh centesis needle. A total of approximately 150 to 200 cc of bloody ascites was obtained.  The patient's hemodynamics remained tenuous, so under real-time ultrasound guidance the right portal vein that we had access was reaccessed using ultrasound and a micropuncture needle, with fluoroscopic confirmation of the correct portal vein (coil being moved by the wire). Additional tract embolization was performed with Gelfoam slurry and glue.   At the end of the case, the patient remained in critical condition and was discharged under the immediate care of anesthesiology back to the ICU.

US-guided right common femoral artery access. 2. Visceral angiography 3. Celiac artery angiography 4. Proper hepatic angiography 5. Aortic balloon placement  FINDINGS: ANGIOGRAPHY: Vessels catheterized using base catheter and microcatheter\/microwire combination and angiograms performed:  Aorta: No active hemorrhage; significant tortuosity in the iliac artery and aorta. Celiac artery: No active hemorrhage. Aneurysmal ectasia of the celiac artery origin. Pseudoaneurysms in the right hepatic artery and the left gastric artery.  Superior mesenteric artery: No active hemorrhage.  Right hepatic artery: Pseudoaneurysm identified. Right hepatic arter access obtained with 018 microwire and 2.8 microcatheter system . Angiogram via microcatheter identified pseudoaneurysm distal to the origin of a small left hepatic artery.  No 018 covered stents available to negotiate this tortuous anatomy to the distal right hepatic artery. Several unsuccessful attempts were made to convert the 018 system to a 035 system to match the available 035 covered system. None of the 035 catheters would track over the 018 system beyond the celiac axis.   6F Vascular sheath was placed for additional stability and fresh attempt to access the proper hepatic artery was contemplated when Anesthesia alerted of further instability with Blood pressure.  No catheters dor wires were in the hepatic artery at the time.  A 5f Omni flush catheter was placed above the celiac axis and a flush aortogram done.  This showed active bleeding from the area of the distal right hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm. Surgery team was notified of the findings and the recommendations for acute surgical intervention.   Low profile aortic Occlusion Ballon was not available therefore, a 180 Lunderquist wire was passed via the omni flush catheter and the 6 French vascular sheath exchanged for a 10 F short vascular sheath.  A Coda Balloon was passed over the wire to the celiac axis and inflated with dilute contrast to achieve hemostasis at the celiac aorta.  The Lunderquist Wire was maintained in the aorta to provide support and prevent migration since the thoracic and abdominal aorta were ectatic and tortuous.

IMPRESSION:   Identification of right hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm  supplying the most of the liver parenchyma.  Smaller left gastrohepatic trunk with possible pseudoaneurysm near origin.   Unable to access proper hepatic artery with 035 system because of very tortuous anatomy of the celiac and hepatic axis. The Pseudoaneurysm again bled before this system could be placed to consider 035 covered stent deployment.   Embolization of the right hepatic artery with the 018 microcatheter system was not a survivable event. Right hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm rupture.

Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. An 0.035\" wire was advanced into the aorta. A 5F vascular sheath was placed over the wire into the common femoral artery. A side flush was started.  A 5-Fr diagnostic catheter was advanced over an 0.035\" wire into the abdominal aorta. The catheter was used to catheterize the vessels described above. Angiograms were performed. A microcatheter system was used to catheterize distal vessels, as described above. Specific vessels catheterized as described in detail above. The 018 microcatheter could not be converted to 035 system for covered stent deployment. Access to the hepatic artery was lost due to significant significant arterial tortuosity.

Treatment Plan:   The catheter tip is in good position. The line flushes and aspirates appropriately.  The catheter is okay to use.  Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed above.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Subsequently, the right chest was anesthetized with lidocaine solution , both with and without epinephrine. An incision was made. A port pocket was created. The port reservoir was placed within the port pocket after adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The port was not affixed to the chest wall with suture.  The catheter was tunneled under the skin of the right  chest.   Under fluoroscopic guidance, a peel-away sheath was advanced through the venotomy site over a guide wire to the level of the right atrium. The catheter was inserted through the peel-away sheath and into the  internal jugular vein  via a peel-away sheath after removal of the dilator and wire. Static fluoroscopic image was obtained documenting the tip of the port catheter in good position near the cavoatrial junction. The port flushes and aspirates appropriately.   The port pocket was closed with buried, interrupted subcutaneous 2-0 absorbable sutures. A running 4-0 absorbable subcuticular stitch and  Dermabond was used to close the skin.

Patient underwent kyphoplasty at outside hospital with extravasation of cement that embolized with a few fragments in the bilateral peripheral pulmonary arteries as well as one longer thin fragment across the bifurcation of the right and left pulmonary arteries. Patient is symptomatic and short of breath.  Procedure:   1.\tUltrasound guided right common femoral venous access.  2.\tCatheterization of the main, left main, and right main pulmonary arteries. 3.\tArteriogram of the left main pulmonary artery. 4.\tAttempted intravascular foreign body retrieval.  Findings:   1.\tLargest fragment noted on fluoroscopy across the bifurcation of the left and right pulmonary arteries. 2.\tPost procedure fragmentation of the largest cement fragment that travel further into segmental left pulmonary artery branches.    Impression:   1.\t Attempted retrieval of largest cement fragment. The brittle thin cement fragment fractured during the procedure and travelled distally.  Treatment Plan:   Attempted retrieval of thin cement fragment that fractured during attempted retrieval. As discussed with the family prior to the procedure, it is preferred for the fragments to be smaller and distal rather than in the main pulmonary artery.  Recommend 6 months anticoagulation to allow time for the fragments to endothelialize and prevent clot formation. This recommendation is based on the available literature.  Technique:   The patient was placed supine on the fluoroscopy table. The right groin was prepped and draped in typical sterile fashion. Under continuous ultrasound guidance, using micropuncture technique, the right common femoral vein was accessed. A wire was advanced.  A 10 French sheath was advanced into the right common femoral vein. An [HCW]gled pigtail catheter was used to catheterize the main pulmonary artery, taking care not to pass through cordae tendinae. The catheter was then directed into the right main pulmonary artery where the free edge of the cement fragment was located. Catheter was exchanged for a long 8 French sheath. An ensnare was then advanced through the sheath, and used to grasp the free end of the fragment in the right pulmonary artery.  During this process, the cement fragment fractured twice into smaller pieces which traveled distally into the left segmental pulmonary arteries. Left pulmonary arteriogram was performed demonstrating patent left pulmonary artery with distal location of the cement fragments. It was determined that these could not be retrieved safely in their current location.  All sheaths were removed, and hemostasis was achieved with manual compression. A sterile dressing was applied.

Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by the nurse present during the entire procedure. The patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Sedation was administered by a specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for the duration of the procedure as outlined above (Total intra service time, 30min ). Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Versed 1 mg IV Fentanyl 50 mcg IV Heparin 3000 units IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 5 French Vertebral catheter  Cardiva Vascade Visipaque-270 contrast material (100 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views. Given this patient's good clinical exam, the decision was made not to pursue any intervention discomfort in the distal right M1 segment of the MCA and continue with medical management.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the right internal carotid artery for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Vascade followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Noninvasive imaging.  FINDINGS:  LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: The distal left internal carotid artery and its segments are normal in course and caliber. The MCA and its branches are normal in course and caliber. The left A1 segment of the ACA supplies the bilateral ACA territories. There are extensive collaterals from the right distal ACA branches into the right MCA territory. There are no underlying aneurysms or significant stenosis. There is normal cortical venous drainage.  LEFT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Reflux of contrast into the contralateral vertebral artery was not achieved. The origin of PICA is normal unilaterally (we will defer to CTA for evaluation of the contralateral PICA). The basilar artery and its branches are unremarkable. There are numerous collaterals with the posterior aspect of the right MCA territory from the right PCA.  RIGHT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY, CERVICAL: The bifurcation is smooth, without irregularity, calcification, or stenosis with respect to the distal ICA. The ECA branches opacify normally.  RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is an inferiorly directed right posterior communicating artery aneurysm measuring 5.5 x 5 mm with a 3.5 mm neck. The right posterior communicating artery originates at the base of this aneurysm. The aneurysm itself is mildly irregular in shape. In addition, there is a subocclusive clot at the right MCA bifurcation with slow filling of the MCA branches distally. There is occlusion of multiple distal M3 branches. Upon review of imaging from collaterals with the ACA and PCA territories, the majority of the territory supplied by these branches fills from these collaterals. The right A1 segment of the ACA is hypoplastic with early washout of contrast suggesting dominant flow from the contralateral hemisphere.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated the previously described inferiorly directed right posterior communicating artery aneurysm measuring 5.5 x 5 mm with a 3.8 mm neck. The right posterior communicating artery originates at the base of this aneurysm. There is redemonstration of the subocclusive clot at the distal M1 and MCA bifurcation with filling of the M2 branches distally.  COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: There is an inferiorly directed right posterior communicating artery aneurysm measuring 5.5 x 5 mm with a 3.8 mm neck. This aneurysm itself is mildly irregular in shape and the posterior communicating artery itself arises from the base of this aneurysm.   In addition, there is a subocclusive clot noted in the distal right M1 segment and MCA bifurcation with slow filling of the M2 branches.

Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, spinal cord infarction, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, hemorrhage, nontargeted embolization, necrosis of skin or mucus membranes, renal failure, limb loss, death, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite, intubated, and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the Right femoral artery; a 6 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath was introduced into the Right femoral artery. 5000  units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was completed of the above vessels. Digital angiograms were performed centered over the head and face.   Following access into the Right external carotid artery, 2 mg of intra-arterial milrinone was administered for vasospasm noted in the proximal portion of the right middle meningeal artery. A run was performed of the Right external carotid artery following injection.  Super selective catheterization of the right middle meningeal artery was then performed with the [VENDOR]sior 1018 microcatheter and transcend-EX microguidewire. Due to vasospasm of the middle meningeal artery, the decision was made to move to the left middle meningeal artery to allow for resolution of the vasospasm. The diagnostic catheter was transferred to the left external carotid artery and converted to a guide catheter.  Superselective catheterization of the Left middle meningeal artery was then performed with the Excelsior 1018 microcatheter and Transcend-EX microguidewire. Contour PVA particles were prepared on an adjacent table and maintained in isobaric suspension with appropriate quantities of saline and contrast and injected into the Left middle meningeal artery using a pulse-spray technique over several minutes.

A final run was performed of the right common carotid artery.  An XPER CT scan was completed to evaluate for any underlying hematoma.  Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Cardiva Vascade followed by manual compression. A Tegaderm was then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: noninvasive imaging.  FINDINGS:   RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: The distal right internal carotid artery and its segments are normal course and caliber. The MCA and its branches are normal course and caliber. The right A1 segment of the ACA supplies the bilateral ACA territories. There is a markedly rightward bowing of the bilateral ACA branches likely from underlying mass effect from the mass. There is a branch of the left ACA which appears to supply the mass itself although the mass does not demonstrate significant vascularity on this injection. There are no underlying aneurysms or significant stenoses. There is normal cortical venous drainage.  RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: The frontal branch of the right middle meningeal artery traverses midline and appears to supply the medial aspect of the left parafalcine mass.

LEFT MIDDLE MENINGEAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL (PRE-EMBOLIZATION): No anastomoses with the right ophthalmic artery are demonstrated. No arteriovenous shunting or dural fistula is seen. There is redemonstration of filling of the left parafalcine mass from the distal branch of the frontal meningeal artery.  LEFT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-EMBOLIZATION): Interval embolization of the frontal branch of the middle meningeal artery with significant stagnation of flow. No other vessel occlusions are identified. The tumor blush of the left parafalcine mass is no longer visualized.  RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No anastomosis resulting in ipsilateral ophthalmic artery or intracranial perfusion is identified. There remains mild vasospasm of the proximal portion of the right middle meningeal artery.  RIGHT MIDDLE MENINGEAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL (PRE-EMBOLIZATION): There is a direct arteriovenous fistula between the frontal branch of the middle meningeal artery and dural draining veins. There remains filling of the left parasagittal mass.   RIGHT MIDDLE MENINGEAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST TUMOR EMBOLIZATION): Interval embolization of the distal portion of the frontal branch of the right middle meningeal artery with significant stagnation of flow no residual filling of the left parasagittal mass.

COMPLICATIONS: Iatrogenic right middle meningeal artery dural arteriovenous fistula status-post coil embolization  IMPRESSION: 1.\tSuccessful intracranial PVA embolization through bilateral middle meningeal artery for preoperative embolization of a left parasagittal mass. Procedure complicated by iatrogenic right middle meningeal artery dural arteriovenous fistula which was successfully embolized with coils.   HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST  INDICATION: Preoperative embolization of a left parasagittal mass via bilateral middle meningeal arteries: Rule out hemorrhage following iatrogenic right middle meningeal artery dural arteriovenous fistula.   TECHNIQUE: XPER computed tomography images were obtained. Axial images from the skull base to the vertex were reconstructed.   COMPARISON: Preprocedure head CT.   FINDINGS:  The limitations of the XPER CT technique need to be noted. There is no evidence of contrast staining in the right hemisphere. There is no definite evidence of any intraparenchymal or extra-axial hemorrhage. There is no evidence of any large areas of hypodensity but the resolution of the XPER CT technique does not allow for proper definition of early infarcts. There is no evidence of significant mass effect or midline shift. The ventricles are normal in size shape and position.   IMPRESSION:  There is no evidence of any intraparenchymal or extra-axial hemorrhage. If clinically indicated brain MRI with gradient echo sequence would be helpful to establish the presence of hemorrhage. "}

{"ReportID":7407433,"ContentText_DEID":"CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM AND ONYX EMBOLIZATION OF A INTRANIDAL ANEURYSMS  CLINICAL INDICATION: 29-year-old female with no significant past medical history who presented with one week of right facial weakness was discovered to have a right CP angle arteriovenous malformation. Diagnostic cerebral angiogram revealed a feeding artery\/intranidal aneurysm in the vicinity of the cranial nerve VII root entry zone. It was felt that her symptoms were most likely caused by change in this aneurysm. Embolization of this aneurysm is indicated to help treat mass effect and reduced risk of rupture.  PROCEDURE: Diagnostic cerebral angiogram, Onyx embolization of feeding artery\/intranidal aneurysm of right CP angle arteriovenous malformation.  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 1.5 hours.  OPERATORS: [HCW], was the attending physician and supervised the entire procedure. [HCW] and [HCW] were the fellows. Each actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right vertebral artery Hypertrophied right-sided pontine perforator, superselective Right common femoral artery  VESSELS TREATED: Right accessory superior cerebellar artery  ANESTHESIA: General.

Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, angionecrosis, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, non-target embolization, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite, intubated, and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right common femoral artery. A 6 French Terum[VENDOR] Pinnacle sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery. 5000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement; additional boluses of heparin were administered at one-hour intervals, and ACT was checked to maintain values between 250-300. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of the arteries listed above. Digital angiograms were performed centered over the head and skull base.   3D rotational angiography of the right vertebral artery was performed with the guide catheter in the distal V2 segment for better evaluation of the angioarchitecture of the arteriovenous malformation. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.   Superselective catheterization of the accessory superior cerebellar artery was performed with the Apollo 1.5cm detachable tip microcatheter and [VENDOR] X10 microguidewire and a superselective angiogram was performed. 0.7 cc of DMSO was then infused in a timed fashion and Onyx-18 liquid embolic agent was injected under blank roadmap technique over several minutes. The microcatheter was removed without difficulty. A final control angiogram was performed to assess for residual aneurysm or for distal emboli.  Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine.  An angiogram of the right common femoral artery was obtained to confirm that the arterial puncture was above the bifurcation and not retroperitoneal. Ancef was administered.  Hemostasis was achieved by application of a 6 Fr Mynx . A Tegaderm was then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: Diagnostic cerebral angiogram from [DATE].  FINDINGS:  RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: Revisualized is an arteriovenous malformation in the region of the right brachium pontis as seen on prior angiogram and MRI which is supplied by large hypertrophied pontine perforators as well as small feeders from the right PICA and SCA. Unchanged intranidal aneurysms which are likely source of the patient's symptoms via mass effect on cranial nerve VII. Drainage is via the IPS to the right sigmoid sinus and intercavernous sinus as well as an ectatic cerebellar vein over the left hemisphere to the left sigmoid sinus.   RIGHT-SIDED HYPERTROPHIED PONTINE PERFORATOR (SUPERSELECTIVE): The catheter is intravascular and proximal to the aneurysms. No perfusion of normal brain tissue is noted.  RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL (status post Onyx embolization): Post-treatment surveillance angiography demonstrates interval embolization of arteriovenous malformation feeding artery. There is Onyx embolization material within the nidus. The previously seen intranidal aneurysms are no longer visualized.. No perfusion deficits to suggest distal emboli are identified.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY:  3-D rotational angiography demonstrated the aforementioned arteriovenous malformation with intranidal aneurysms as described above. The larger of the 2 intracranial aneurysms which originates off of one of the hypertrophy pontine perforators is highly irregular and multilobulated and measures roughly 5.8 x 4.3 x 2.4 mm (axial by neck-to-dome by neck)..   RIGHT COMMON FEMORAL ARTERY: The arteriotomy is above the bifurcation of the right common femoral artery. There is a small amount of narrowing of the common femoral artery just distal to the arteriotomy which may represent vasospasm. The arteriotomy was closed with 6 French Mynx.  COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION:  Successful Onyx embolization of right brachium pontis arteriovenous malformation intranidal aneurysms which were the likely source of the patient's facial weakness via mass effect on the 7th cranial nerve..

Specifically, the risks of intracranial or systemic hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, distal emboli, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, device malfunction, groin hematoma, arterial dissection\/laceration, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite, intubated, and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 9 French sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery . The 8 French Walrus balloon guide-catheter and 5 French diagnostic long selection catheter were introduced into the right internal carotid artery as a system over the Terumo Glidewire.The wire and diagnostic catheter were then removed and the balloon guide was connected to a continual heparinized saline flush. Digital angiograms were performed centered over the head.   There was a subocclusive clot\/stenosis within the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery with resultant delayed flow through the right MCA territory as compared to the ACA territory.  The Marksman microcatheter and Asahi 018 microwire were then advanced through the Zoom 71  aspiration catheter into the guide catheter as a system past the right M1 occlusion. The wire was removed from the microcatheter, and intravascular position was confirmed with contrast injection. The Trevo NXT stentriever device was then tacked up the microcatheter and the stentriever was deployed under fluoroscopy. A run was performed through the aspiration catheter with the stentriever was deployed with resultant improved flow through the right middle cerebral artery. With the stentriever in place and deployed, there was no significant delay between the right middle cerebral artery and right anterior cerebral artery territories. The Zoom 71 aspiration catheter was then tracked to the face of the clot with continuous aspiration on through the Penumbra aspiration machine.  Once in place, the aspiration catheter was noted to be 'plugged' with occlusive suction against the clot.  The balloon on the guide catheter was then inflated. The stentriever was then removed under continuous aspiration using a 60cc locking syringe system. Thrombus was not  identified within the stentriever device or the aspirate.  The balloon on the guide was deflated and a cerebral angiogram was performed through the guide catheter. As compared with the immediate prior run or the stentriever was deployed, there is slight delay in the filling of the MCA territory compared to the ACA territory, but not quite to baseline. Additional repeat run showed progressive slowing of the perfusion of right MCA as compared to the ACA territory. The decision was to proceed with placement of intracranial stent. An XperCT was performed to evaluate for any evidence of hemorrhage. XperCT showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. 300 mg of aspirin was given PR. And Aggrastat bolus of 12.5 mcg\/kg was administered IV followed by a drip of 0.15 mcg\/kg\/m.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the cervical right internal carotid artery for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture and measurement of the vessel caliber for sizing of the stent. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    The marksman microcatheter and Asahi 18 microguidewire were then advanced through the 6 French Sofia catheter into the balloon guide catheter to the ophthalmic segment of the ICA. The marksman microcatheter and Asahi microguidewire were removed. The Onyx frontier drug-eluting stent was advanced through the Sofia guide catheter over and Asahi 014 microguidewire. Under fluoroscopic guidance it was advanced over the Asahi 014 microguidewire across the area of subtotal occlusion. The balloon was inflated submaximal to 7 atm (opening diameter of 1.85 mm for the stent).  The balloon was deflated and a run was performed through the Sofia guide catheter after was pulled down into the petrous segment of the ICA. There is noted to be improved caliber and contrast opacification of the previously partially occluded M1 segment with improved filling of the distal MCA territory with which was now in phase with the ACA territory. There is no evidence of distal perfusion deficit.  An angiogram of the right common femoral artery was obtained; the artery was deemed appropriate for use of the 8 French Angio-Seal closure device. The sheath was removed and hemostasis obtained by deployment of the 8 French Angio-Seal closure device. A Tegaderm was then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: CTA from same date.  FINDINGS:  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a subocclusive clot\/stenosis within the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery with resultant delayed flow through the right MCA territory as compared to the ACA territory.  RIGHT MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERY, SUPERSELECTIVE: The microcatheter in intravascular and distal to the partial occlusion.

There is no evidence of distal perfusion deficit.  RIGHT FEMORAL ARTERY: No abnormalities are detected. This vessel is suitable for use of the 8 French Angio-Seal closure device.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated the aforementioned subocclusive clot\/stenosis within the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery. This 3-D imaging was obtained in order to permit more precise measurement of the vessel caliber for sizing of the intracranial stent..   COMPLICATIONS: none immediate.  IMPRESSION:  1. Right middle cerebral artery subocclusive clot\/stenosis within the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery with resultant delayed flow through the right MCA territory as compared to the ACA territory.   2. Successful placement of Onyx frontier drug-eluting stent within the stenotic\/partially occluded M1 segment with resultant significantly improved distal perfusion and resolution of the delay between the MCA and ACA territory.  *Patient will need to remain on DAPT for period of one year following placement of drug-eluting stent.   HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST  INDICATION: Right MCA stroke status post endovascular procedure: Rule out hemorrhage.   TECHNIQUE: XPER computed tomography images were obtained. Axial images from the skull base to the vertex were reconstructed.   COMPARISON: Preprocedure head CT.   FINDINGS:  The limitations of the XPER CT technique need to be noted. There is no evidence of contrast staining in the right hemisphere. There is no definite evidence of any intraparenchymal hemorrhage. There is no evidence of any large areas of hypodensity but the resolution of the XPER CT technique does not allow for proper definition of early infarcts. There is no evidence of significant mass effect or midline shift. The ventricles are normal in size shape and position.   IMPRESSION:  There is no evidence of contrast staining in the right hemisphere. No definite evidence of any intraparenchymal hemorrhage. If clinically indicated brain MRI with gradient echo sequence would be helpful to establish the presence of hemorrhage."}

Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, hemorrhage, nontargeted embolization, necrosis of skin or mucus membranes, renal failure, limb loss, death, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.  After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion after intubation by the anesthesiology team.  Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 5000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following the sheath placement; additional boluses of heparin were administered at one-hour intervals. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of the above listed vessels. Digital angiograms were performed of these vessels, centered over the head.   Following the diagnostic portion of the angiogram, the Excelsior 1018 microcatheter and Asahi 14 microguidewire were passed coaxially through the diagnostic catheter into the middle meningeal artery artery. The large sphenoid branch with anastomosis to the lacrimal artery with competitive flow indicated a large caliber anastomosis between the middle meningeal artery and orbital vasculature via the recurrent meningeal artery. Given this configuration, the navigated our microcatheter quite distal into the frontal division to avoid reflux and potentially embolizing the retina. We specifically did not catheterize the parietal branches that had relatively little capacitance and reflux risk backing out to the common bifurcation sphenoid branch. Contour PVA particles were then prepared in the usual fashion with appropriate quantities of saline and contrast in order to maintain the particles in isobaric suspension and injected into the frontal division of the right middle meningeal artery using a pulse spray technique. A Gelfoam pledget was injected into the frontal division of the middle meningeal artery following the PVA embolization.   Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Cardiva Vascade followed by manual compression. A Tegaderm was then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: Axial imaging.  FINDINGS:  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: Normal arterial and venous anatomy. The choroidal blush is noted.  RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: Normal arterial and venous anatomy.

After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery. A 6 French sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery. 5000 units of heparin were administered intravenously after sheath placement; additional boluses of heparin were administered at one-hour intervals. Using fluoroscopic guidance, the left common carotid artery was selectively catheterized with the 5 French Simmons 3 catheter.

Treatment Plan:   1.\tPatient will be admitted to ICU for overnight monitoring  Technique:   Following written informed consent, the patient was placed supine on the procedure table. After induction of general anesthesia, the right neck and abdomen were prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.   Paracentesis: The abdomen was evaluated with ultrasound. An appropriate skin entry site was chosen and anesthetized with local. Under ultrasound guidance, a 21-gauge needle was advanced into the peritoneal space. A 0.018 inch wire was advanced into the peritoneal space, and the needle was exchanged for a transitional dilator. A transitional dilator was exchanged for an 0.035 inch wire and a drain was advanced into the peritoneal space and wire was removed. The drain was attached to suction and was drained during the case.  Access: The right neck was then evaluated with ultrasound. The skin overlying the right internal jugular vein was anesthetized with local, and a small dermatotomy was made.  Under ultrasound guidance a 21-gauge needle was advanced into the right internal jugular vein. A 0.018\" guidewire was advanced through the micropuncture needle. The needle was exchanged for a 5 French transitional catheter. The 0.018\" wire and inner dilator were removed, and a 0.035\" wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava.  The transitional catheter was exchanged for a sheath. An angled catheter was placed over the wire and used to select the right hepatic vein. A right hepatic venogram was obtained.   Notes on access catheter\/sheath combination: 5 French MPA\/10-Fr sheath  ICE (Intra-cardiac echo) technique: A second access site was obtained in the neck using ultrasound guidance and a vascular sheath. This sheath was guided using fluoroscopy into the hepatic venous confluence and utilized to advance the ICE. Real-time echo imaging was then utilized to target an appropriate portal radical, with attention paid to avoid traversal of critical intrahepatic vessels\/bile ducts and extrahepatic structures.  Pre-TIPS Pressures:  Right atrial and hepatic pressure measurements were obtained using a balloon catheter\/sheath, as detailed:  Right atrial: 17 mm Hg Direct portal: 34 mm Hg  CO2 Portography: No   TIPS: Using the Argon ScorpionX TIPS set, the right portal vein was accessed, which was confirmed with the hand-injection of contrast. A 0.035\" Bentson wire was advanced into the portal vein. A 4 Fr glide catheter was advanced over the wire into the SMV. The 10 Fr sheath was advanced over the glide catheter and the Bentson but was unsuccessful. A 6mm balloon was used to dilate the TIPS tract. The sheath was then successfully advanced in combination with a Lunderquist wire. TIPS sheaths were advanced over the wire into the portal vein. A marking pigtail catheter was advanced over the guidewire and used to measure the parenchymal tract and measure portal venous pressure. The sheath was ultimately advanced into the main portal vein, and a Viatorr stent was deployed within the TIPS shunt. The shunt was dilated throughout using a high pressure balloon. Follow-up portogram demonstrated good flow through the TIPS shunt with no filling of collaterals.

Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, spinal cord infarction, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, hemorrhage, nontargeted embolization, necrosis of skin or mucus membranes, renal failure, limb loss, death, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.  After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion after intubation by the anesthesiology team.  Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following the sheath placement; additional boluses of heparin were administered at one-hour intervals. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of the above listed vessels. Digital angiograms were performed of these vessels, centered over the neck and head.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the cervical segment of the left internal carotid artery for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    Following the diagnostic portion of the angiogram, the Excelsior 1018 microcatheter and Transcend-EX microguidewire were passed coaxially through the Cordis vertebral catheter into the distal internal maxillary artery artery. Contour PVA particles were then prepared in the usual fashion with appropriate quantities of saline and contrast in order to maintain the particles in isobaric suspension and injected into the branches of the internal maxillary artery supplying the meningioma artery using a pulse spray technique. The microcatheter was withdrawn partially and microrun showed additional supply to the tumor from the distal branches of the internal maxillary artery. Additional PVA embolization was performed using the same technique. The microguidewire and microcatheter were then advanced into the branch of the middle meningeal artery supplying the meningioma where PVA embolization was performed using the same technique.  Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Cardiva Vascade followed by manual compression. A Tegaderm was then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: Noninvasive imaging including MRI of brain dated [DATE].

Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   [HCW]fter informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery. An angiogram of the right femoral artery was obtained through the outer cannula of the dilator to evaluate the arteriotomy.  A 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the proximal cervical segment of the right internal carotid artery for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the proximal cervical segment of the left internal carotid artery for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the proximal V2 segment of the left vertebral artery for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Vascade followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: CTA dated [DATE].  FINDINGS:  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is an infundibular origin of the right posterior communicating artery, which is better visualized on the 3-D rotational angiography discussed below. There is a fenestration of the anterior communicating artery which is again further visualized on 3-D rotational angiography discussed below.  No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified.    RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: As visualized on right internal carotid artery injection, there is a fenestration of the anterior communicating artery which is better visualized on 3-D rotational angiogram discussed below.

Specifically, the risks of intracranial or systemic hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, distal emboli, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, device malfunction, groin hematoma, arterial dissection\/laceration, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite, intubated, and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 8 French sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery. The 8 French Walrus balloon guide-catheter and 5 French diagnostic long selection catheter were introduced into the left common carotid artery as a system.   A roadmap angiogram was then completed of the common carotid artery to visualize the carotid bifurcation. The diagnostic catheter was then used to select the internal carotid artery over the 180 cm long 0.035\" Terumo Glidewire. The balloon guide catheter was then advanced into the cervical internal carotid artery over the wire and selection catheter. The wire and diagnostic catheter were then removed. Digital angiograms were performed centered over the head.   The initial TICI score was 0.  The Marksman microcatheter and Aristotle microwire were then advanced through Zoom 71  aspiration catheter into the guide catheter as a system past the left M1 occlusion. The wire was removed from the microcatheter, and intravascular position was confirmed with contrast injection. The Trevo NXT stentriever device was then tacked up the microcatheter and the stentriever was deployed under fluoroscopy and the allowed to set in the clot for 5 minutes. The microcatheter was removed so that that the stentriever was \"naked\" in the aspiration catheter.  The Zoom 71 aspiration catheter was then tracked to the face of the clot with continuous aspiration on through the [VENDOR] aspiration machine.  Once in place, the aspiration catheter was noted to be 'plugged' with occlusive suction against the clot.  The balloon on the guide catheter was then inflated. The stentriever was then removed under continuous aspiration using a 60cc [VENDOR]-[VENDOR]k locking syringe system. Thrombus was  identified within the stentriever device and the aspirate.  The balloon on the guide was deflated and a cerebral angiogram was performed through the guide catheter. Recanalization of the left MCA was achieved with revascularization of the distal territory consistent with TICI 2C.  An angiogram of the right common femoral artery was obtained; the artery was deemed appropriate for use of the 8 French Angio-Seal closure device.

Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire pr[HCW].  VESSELS CATHETERIZED: Right internal carotid artery Right middle cerebral artery  VESSELS INJECTED: Right common femoral artery Right internal carotid artery  VESSELS TREATED (in sequence): Right internal carotid artery  ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. Pre-, intra-, and post-anesthesia monitoring records are available in the chart.  MEDICATIONS:  Heparin 8000 units IV Protamine 25 mg IV Ancef 2 grams IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 8 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 0.035\" Bentson Guidewire 0.035\" exchange length Bentson 071 Penumbra Benchmark guide catheter (115 cm) with vert insert Phenom 27 microcatheter (150 cm) Asahi 018 microguidewire (200 cm) 4.0 mm x 12 mm pipeline embolization device Perclose ProGlide closure device Omnipaque-300 contrast (100 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, stent thrombosis\/stenosis, stent migration, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, non-target embolization, puncture site hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite, intubated, and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery. Through the dilator sheath, an angiogram of the of the right common femoral artery was obtained to ensure the arteriotomy was above the level of the bifurcation and the CFA was of sufficient size to use the Perclose ProGlide closure device. A 6 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 5000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement; additional boluses of heparin were administered at one-hour intervals. The ACT was checked to ensure that it was between 250-300. Using fluoroscopic guidance,  the right internal carotid artery was selectively catheterized. The 071 benchmark catheter was advanced over the benchmark insert selection catheter and the exchange length Bentson guidewire into the proximal horizontal petrous portion of the right internal carotid artery. The selection catheter and guidewire were removed. Digital angiograms were performed in the AP and lateral projections centered over the head and neck.   3D rotational angiography was performed with the guide catheter in the right internal carotid artery artery to better delineate the intracranial vasculature. The acquisition was processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.   A working projection was obtained to best demonstrate the neck of the superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm, as well as, the distal and proximal landing zones for the stent. Superselective catheterization of the middle cerebral artery was performed with the [VENDOR]om 27 microcatheter over the Asahi 18 microguidewire. The tip of the microguidewire was situated in the superior division of the middle cerebral artery. The microguidewire in the pipeline catheter was then exchanged for a 4.0 mm x 12 mm pipeline embolization device. The device was deployed under fluoroscopic guidance and a single shot X-ray was performed to confirm that the distal and proximal ends of the pipeline embolization device were in the right ICA communicating segment and right ICA ophthalmic segment, respectively. Postprocessing of the pipeline embolization device was performed with a curved microwire with successful improvement in apposition of the proximal aspects of the device.  A final AP and Lateral angiogram were completed to evaluate the distal vasculature for perfusion deficits and emboli.   After completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Ancef was administered. The sheath was removed and hemostasis obtained using the Perclose ProGlide closure device. Tegaderms were then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: Diagnostic angiogram dated [DATE] and [DATE].  FINDINGS:  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a compact coil mass seen in the expected location. There is sessile recurrence of the previously coiled superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm which is grossly stable from prior and further visualized on 3-D rotational angiography discussed below. No focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified.   RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION): The Pipeline device is well apposed to the vessel walls throughout it's course without endoleak. . . No perfusion deficits to suggest distal emboli are present.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY: A 3D rotational angiogram of the  right internal carotid was completed and post-processed on an [VENDOR][HOSPITAL]dent work station. 3D angiography demonstrated the previously described sessile recurrence of the previously coiled superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm. This 3-D rotational angiography was performed in order to select views for pipeline device deployment as well as to appropriately sized the pipeline embolization device.  RIGHT COMMON FEMORAL ARTERY: No abnormalities are detected. The arteriotomy was above the level of the bifurcation and the CFA was of sufficient size to use the Perclose ProGlide closure device.   COMPLICATIONS: none immediate.  IMPRESSION:  1.\tGrossly stable appearance of the sessile recurrence of the previously coiled right superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm. 2.\tSuccessful deployment of pipeline embolization device from the communicating segment of the right internal carotid artery to the proximal ophthalmic segment of the right internal carotid artery, and covering the ostium of the aneurysm. The stent is well apposed to the vessel wall without endoleak. "}

Hopefully, his encephalopathy will be improved enough that he can reduce his current dosage of Lactulose and his portal vein will remain patent to allow for orthotopic liver transplantation.   5. In addition, he is still very interested in surgical repair of his right inguinal hernia and hydrocele. 6. Follow-up with me in clinic in 3-4 weeks to assess his encephalopathy.  If it is still a problem, would plan to discuss further embolization and\/or TIPS creation with him, his wife, and [HCW].   TECHNIQUE: The patient was placed in the supine position on the angiography table and the abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Under direct ultrasound guidance with aseptic technique, local anesthetic was administered using 1% lidocaine, and a 22-gauge needle was placed into a peripheral portal vessel within the target organ described above. A peripheral splenic vein branch was cannulated and a microwire was passed centrally under fluoroscopy. The needle was then removed and a transitional dilator, sheath, and catheter were placed over the wire in series, and advanced centrally under fluoroscopy. A  7-French sheath was placed over the wire and advanced into the portal venous system. A diagnostic catheter was advanced through the sheath over the wire, and venography was performed, with findings detailed above. Venography was performed using both iodinated contrast and CO2, to limit the total iodinated contrast volume.  Additional vessels were catheterized and angiograms were performed, as detailed above. Embolization was performed are detailed above. Post-treatment venography findings are listed above.  All catheters and wires were removed from the patient. The sheath was retracted under fluoroscopic guidance peripherally with continuous contrast injection to delineate the access site with the assistance of real time ultrasound. The access site was embolized in retrograde fashion through the indwelling sheath using the technique delineated above. Hemostasis was achieved and the access site was dressed appropriately.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition without any immediate postprocedural complications.

Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, balloon rupture, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, heart block, hypotension, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery. A 5 French sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery. 5000 units of heparin were administered intravenously after sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, the above listed arteries were selectively catheterized with the 5 French diagnostic catheter. Digital angiograms were performed centered over the head. 15 mg of intra-arterial verapamil were administered in the left ICA over 10 minutes. Subsequently 15 mg of verapamil were administered intra-arterially into the right ICA. Follow-up angiogram left internal carotid artery. Continued severe spasm. 10 mg of intra-arterial milrinone were administered into the left ICA approximately 20 minutes.   A follow-up control angiogram was performed of the left internal carotid artery showed significant improvement in the degree of vasospasm.  Following completion of the procedure, hemostasis was achieved by application of a Mynx device. Gauze and Tegaderms were then applied over the puncture site.

Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the left internal carotid artery for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Mynx followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Prior angiogram from [DATE].  FINDINGS:  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is redemonstration of the previously known right superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm measuring 3 x 2 mm. This is unchanged in size and appearance from prior angiogram. The ACA and MCA and its branches are normal in course and caliber. There is normal cortical venous drainage.   LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: Interval compaction of the coil mass.  The previously coil embolized left posterior communicating artery aneurysm demonstrates minimal residual filling at the base of the aneurysm. This measures 1.8 x 1 mm with a 3 mm neck. The posterior communicating artery is patent and arises from the base of the aneurysm. The ACA and MCA and its branches are normal course and caliber. There is normal cortical venous drainage.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated residual filling at the base of the previously coil embolized left posterior communicating artery aneurysm measuring 1.8 x 1 mm with a 3 mm neck. The posterior communicating artery is patent and arises from the patient's aneurysm.  COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: 1. Interval coil compaction and residual filling at the base of the previously coil embolized left posterior communicating artery aneurysm measuring 1.8 x 1 mm with a 3 mm neck. The posterior communicating artery is patent and arises from the base of this aneurysm.  2. The previously identified right superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm is unchanged in size and appearance and measures 3 x 2 mm. 3. The patient was advised to discontinue aspirin.  [HCW], was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance. "}

This intra-operative procedure was severely limited by the radiographic equipment, with rapid onset of the X-ray tube over-heating; repeated and prolonged need to pause to allow for cooling of the persistently over-heated X-ray tube.    Sterile technique and fluoroscopic guidance were used to inject contrast via the indwelling left NT. Exchange was made over an 0.035-in Amplatz wire for an 8-Fr. introducer sheath.  Through this, a 5-Fr. angled glide catheter, over an 0.035-in glide wire, was used to negotiate past the calyx, in attempt to intubate the renal pelvis.  There was some success, with the distal catheter tip reaching the superior aspect of the renal pelvis, albeit without the ability to further advance the catheter.   21-g needle access was then gained to a different, immediately more superior calyx, with exchange made over an 0.018-in Cope wire for a 5-Fr.

The patient was placed on the table in a supine position. Following standard prepping and draping, the right common femoral vein was punctured using a needle. Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. Permanent recording and reporting of the saved image and study into the PACS system was performed. Using this access, an 0.035\" wire was advanced into the IVC. A vascular sheath was placed over the wire into the common femoral vein.  Using a reverse curve catheter, the left renal vein was catheterized and angiography was performed. The communicating gastrorenal shunt was then catheterized using the diagnostic catheter and angiography was performed. Using a stiff wire for exchange, the existing catheter was removed and replaced with a long vascular sheath, which was placed carefully into the shunt. A balloon catheter was introduced through the sheath and utilized to opacify the shunt in retrograde fashion. Using the balloon and a microcatheter\/microwire combination, the shunt was cannulated and sclerosed\/embolized using the technique detailed above. Angiography was then repeated to ensure technical success.  All catheters and wires were removed from the patient. Manual pressure was used for hemostasis.

Technique:   The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure and sedation were explained to the patient. The specific risks of bleeding, vascular damage and pulmonary embolus were detailed and accepted. Written informed consent was obtained. A time out\/call to order was performed prior to procedure initiation.  The patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed on the table in supine position. The right neck was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).   The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the access site were infiltrated with lidocaine for local anesthetic. Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency. Under continuous ultrasound guidance, with permanent recording and reporting, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018\" wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire. Through the micropuncture introducer set, an 0.035\" Amplatz wire was advanced into the IVC under fluoroscopic guidance. The Cook retrievable set sheath was placed at the access site and advanced into the IVC and cavography was then performed, with no evidence of caval thrombus, or significant filter tilt.  Initial attempts to snare the filter using standard loops near and Tulip snare techniques were all unsuccessful. We then exchanged the Cook retrievable set for Argon [VENDOR]k 16 French\/14 French sheath combination, and converted to hangman technique using a reverse curve SOS2 catheter, 0.035 inch exchange length Glidewire, and loop snare. The filter was able to being engaged using hangman technique, however could not be over sheathed.  Given the difficulties, the indwelling sheath was then upsize to an 18 French sheath. Through the 18 French sheath, forceps were used to engage the apex of the filter off of the vessel wall. The grasped filter\/forceps were sheathed over and the filter was removed without issue.  After retrieval from the patient, the filter was deployed on the procedure table to document adequate capture and removal of all components of the filter itself.   Post-filter removal venography was then performed, without any findings of caval injury.   All instruments and devices were removed and hemostasis achieved with a woggle suture.

Of note, there is an additional lesion in the distal femur metaphysis that was not PET avid.  TREATMENT PLAN:  1. Admit to orthopedics. Plan for surgical resection tomorrow. 2. Routine post-angiography groin cares ordered.  TECHNIQUE: With the patient in the supine position, the groin was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. Following standard prepping and draping, the left common femoral artery was punctured using a needle. Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. Permanent recording and reporting of the saved image and study into the PACS system was performed. An 0.035\" Bentson wire was advanced into the aorta. A vascular sheath was placed over the wire into the common femoral artery. A side flush was started.  A 5-Fr SOS 2 diagnostic catheter was advanced over an 0.035\" wire into the abdominal aorta, and then used for up and over access. The SOS was then exchanged for a 5 French Kumpe catheter. Initial angiograms were performed to delineate the vascular supply to the tumor, with tumor blush identified off the small branches from both the SFA and DFA.  The SFA was catheterized, and a 2.0 Progreat\/Fathom wire microcatheter\/microwire combination was used to select a feeder vessel supplying the tumor. Embolization was performed as above. Postembolization angiography showed significantly decreased tumor blush.  Attention was then turned to the profunda femoris, and the above microcatheter\/microwire combination was used to select first the small feeders supplying the tumor. Additional embolization as above was performed, to substasis.  A final post embolization angiogram demonstrated significantly decreased tumor blush to the known metastatic lesion; and preserved perfusion down the patient's leg.   The catheters were removed from the patient. A left common femoral artery angiogram was performed, [HCW]trating appropriate vascular access above the profunda femoris artery bifurcation.

Follow-up.  Procedure:  1. Right antegrade nephrostogram and percutaneous nephroureterostomy exchange.   Findings:  1. Right antegrade nephrostogram demonstrates severe mid to distal ureter narrowing, worse since prior exam [DATE]. 2. Newly placed PCNU is appropriately positioned with the proximal loop in the renal pelvis and distal loop in the urinary bladder.  Impression:  Uneventful image-guided exchange of Right percutaneous nephroureterostomy tube. Given interval worsening, decision was made to replace with a PCNU rather than PCN for capping trial.  Plan:   Patient will be due for routine exchange in 8 weeks, preferably after patient has been seen and evaluated by transplant team in their anticipated follow-up visit.  Technique:  With the patient in supine position, the anterior right lower quadrant was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. A scout radiograph was obtained.   Contrast was injected through the existing nephroureterostomy tube and imaging of the collecting was system performed. A 0.035\" wire was placed through the tube and the tube removed over the wire and discarded. The distal tip of the catheter was occluded and able to be traversed using a 0.035\" Glidewire and 5 Fr Kumpe catheter. Over-the-wire, a 9 French by 25 cm sheath was advanced to the ureterovesicular junction where contrast was injected as the sheath was retracted to the collecting system, with findings as above. Sheath was removed, and over the wire a new, 18-French x 25 cm nephroureterostomy tube was advanced over the wire under fluoroscopic guidance as there was interval worsening of the mid to distal ureter stricture since [DATE]. The wire was removed and the proximal loop formed and locked in the bladder. Contrast injection confirmed location.  The catheter was sutured to the anterior abdominal wall and capped.

Impression:   1.\tBrush biopsy x3 and cholangioplasty with exchange of left-sided internal\/external biliary catheter. 2.\t Treatment Plan:   Patient capped to internal drainage. Instructed to place to gravity bag drainage if she experiences significant pain, fevers, chills, or large leakage.  Patient will need to undergo one additional biopsy (she has had 2) to rule out underlying malignancy as a cause of the stricture and an abundance of caution. This could be performed in 3 months the time of her next routine exchange.  At that point, likely will replace 18 French catheter with plans to perform external drain capping trial during the following procedure.  Technique:   The existing catheter and surrounding soft tissues were prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Local anesthetic was injected at the catheter entry site.  A stiff Glidewire was negotiated through the catheter into the small bowel with a 4 French catheter. The Glidewire was exchanged for an Amplatz. The catheter was removed and exchanged for a 14 French sheath. A sheath cholangiogram was performed.  Next, through the sheath, 3 brush biopsies were performed of the anastomotic stricture. These were placed in CytoLyt. Next, over the wire, a 12 mm x 4 cm long Mustang balloon was advanced to the anastomosis. This size balloon was selected based on prior cholangioplasty for this patient. Cholangioplasty was then performed. Contrast was injected demonstrating mild improvement in the appearance of the stricture.

MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Versed 1 mg IV Fentanyl 50 mcg IV Heparin 3000 units IV Protamine 20 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter  Cardiva Vascade Omnipaque-320 contrast material (80 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   The patient was brought into the room directly from the MRI suite with the head-frame already in place.  Informed consent was obtained and the patient was then prepped and draped in the usual fashion.   Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery using constant ultrasound guidance.  Ultrasound images are recorded and permanently available for review in the patient's medical record.    A 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP and Lateral views, consistent with the [HOSPITAL][HOSPITAL] by which images would be transferred to the Gamma Knife system.   Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Vascade followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Prior cerebral angiogram  .  FINDINGS:  LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: Large AVM nidus is noted within the thalamus and basal ganglia with extension into the frontal white matter. Primary feeding artery is served from the lenticular striates and hypertrophied middle cerebral artery branches. A cast of embolic material is seen in the distal left middle cerebral artery territory. Venous drainage is via the Galenic system and the sylvian system to the sphenoparietal sinus. A smaller cortical draining vein to the superior sagittal sinus is noted.  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: The thalamic and posterior aspect of the nidus are opacified by branches of the posterior choroidal arteries, both medial and lateral; as well as, hypertrophied thalamic perforators. Venous drainage is via the Galenic system. No aneurysm or focal stenosis are identified. Reflux of contrast into the contralateral vertebral artery was not achieved. The origin of PICA is normal unilaterally (we will defer to CTA for evaluation of the contralateral PICA).   COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: 1.

Oral contraceptive medications led to left lower extremity (LLE) deep venous thrombosis (DVT).  The latter may have occurred while patient was on oral anticoagulation; therefore a vena caval filter was placed, in [DATE], at a [HOSPITAL] institution, [HOSPITAL].   LLE edema became evident on [DATE], at the same time as a skin ulcer at the inferior half-third aspect of the left anterior tibial region.  This prompted IVC investigation and attempted filter retrieval in [HOSPITAL], [DATE].

Patient has returned to her [HOSPITAL] home, with request for a renewed effort at filter retrieval.    1. continue anticoagulation as indicated. 2. will schedule iliocaval stent reconstruction, following discussion with the patient and her husband   Technique:   Sterile technique and sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance were used to gain 21-g needle access to the RIJV.  Over an 0.018-in Cope wire, exchange was made for a 5-Fr. micropuncture set, affording 0.035-in Rosen wire exchange for a 14\/16-Fr. (Agon) introducer sheath.  Through this, a 5-Fr. straight flush catheter was advanced, with the distal tip advanced to the peri-renal IVC.  Inability advancing past the indwelling caval filter prompted the use of an 0.035-in glide wire over a 5-Fr. angled catheter.  This combination also met the same resistance, with supra-filter, infra-renal caval obstruction suspected.  Contrast examination was performed.     This prompted venographic evaluation from the groin approach.  Sonographic evaluation shows no widely patent CFV lumen.  Similar evaluation shows wide patency of the right GSV.  This was then accessed using a 5-Fr. micropuncture set, at the inferior third of the thigh.  Through this access, contrast examination was performed, as reported above.  Venographic roadmap imaging afforded percutaneous access to the mid right FV, using a 5-Fr. micropuncture set, with sonographic confirmation of no trans-arterial routing.  Contract examination was performed, of the right groin and iliac venous system and the infra-renal IVC.    All instruments and devices were removed and hemostasis achieved with manual compression.

PROCEDURE: Diagnostic cerebral angiogram and ultrasound guided femoral artery access  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 30 minutes.  OPERATORS: [HCW], PhD was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure, interpreted the images, and was present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Left vertebral artery  ANESTHESIA: Local in the right groin with bupivacaine. Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by the nurse present during the entire procedure. The patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Sedation was administered by a specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for the duration of the procedure as outlined above (Total intra service time, 30 ). Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Versed 0.5 mg IV Fentanyl 50 mcg IV Heparin 3000 units IV Protamine 10 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter  Cardiva Vascade Omnipaque-300 contrast material (40 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   The patient was brought into the room directly from the MRI suite with the head-frame already in place.  Informed consent was obtained and the patient was then prepped and draped in the usual fashion.   Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery using constant ultrasound guidance.  Ultrasound images are recorded and permanently available for review in the patient's medical record.    A 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP and Lateral views, consistent with the mechanism by which images would be transferred to the Gamma Knife system.   Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Vascade followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Prior cerebral angiogram, [DATE] and [DATE].  FINDINGS:  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a small, left occipital arteriovenous malformation fed by a single distal PCA branch feeding into a small 1 to 2 cm nidus with drainage superficial venous drainage via a single cortical vein into the superior sagittal sinus. The feeding artery demonstrates mild irregularities and overall is decreased in caliber when compared to the prior angiogram from [DATE] but unchanged from [DATE]. Reflux of contrast into the contralateral vertebral artery was not achieved. The origin of PICA is normal unilaterally although the contralateral PICA has notably been imaged before and negative for abnormalities. The remaining branches of the basilar artery are unremarkable.  COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION:  1. Successful diagnostic angiogram with fiduciary makers to guide stereotactic radiosurgery.  2. Redemonstration of previously described small, left occipital arteriovenous malformation fed by a single distal PCA branch feeding into a small 1 to 2 cm nidus with drainage superficial venous drainage via a single cortical vein into the superior sagittal sinus. The flow through this arteriovenous malformation and the size of the nidus is markedly reduced when compared to the angiogram from 2018  3. Patient had a reaction to protamine when 10U were given over 5 minutes (planned 20U over 10minutes).  Attention to rate of interval protamine administration will be required on follow-up. "}

Procedure:   1.\tPercutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram.  2.\tPlacement of biliary stent 3.\tGelfoam tract embolization  Findings:   1.\tOcclusion of the central left hepatic bile duct secondary to extrinsic compression from known mass. 2.\tInterval resolution of previously seen portobiliary fistula. 3.\tSuccessful placement of uncovered biliary stent across left bile duct stricture (fully uncovered 8 mm x 4 cm WallFlex stent, inflated to 6mm).  Impression:   1.\tInterval resolution of previously seen portobiliary fistula.  2.\tTechnically successful percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and biliary stent placement.  Plan:  Continue to monitor patient's clinical symptoms and trend bilirubin.  Technique:   The anterior abdominal wall and pre-existing left internal\/external biliary drain was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. The drain access site was anesthetized with local lidocaine. An Amplatz wire was advanced through the existing drain into the small bowel, and the drain was removed over the wire. An 8 French sheath was then advanced over the wire, and a pullback sheath cholangiogram demonstrated persistent stricture of the left intrahepatic bile duct without opacification of the previously seen portobiliary fistula.  Biliary stent type: WallFlex Stent size: 8 mm x 4 cm Technique: The pre-existing sheath was removed from the wire, and a 9 French sheath was then placed over the wire. A 5-French marker pigtail catheter was placed over the wire into the biliary tree for measurement.  A cholangiogram was performed, demarcating the location of the biliary confluence, and peripheral entry site. Lesion length was measured. The desired stent was advanced over the wire and positioned using fluoroscopy. The stent was deployed and lesion and stent were dilated with a 6 mm balloon. A final cholangiogram was performed through the sheath demonstrating brisk transit of contrast through the stent down the common bile duct and into the small bowel.  We then attempted placing a 10 French external Amplatz anchor drain; however, drain anchor would not appropriately form given the peripheral nature of the desired placement. The decision was made to abandon the access given brisk flow of contrast through the stent and resolution of previously demonstrated portobiliary fistula.

Vessels catheterized and angiograms performed as detailed below using 5 Fr RAVI MG1 *\tInfrarenal abdominal aortogram: No feeding vessels or inflow to the left flank venous\/lymphatic malformation. There was similar appearance of contrast opacification of the pelvic vessels bilaterally. *\tLeft internal iliac artery: No feeding vessels identified.  *\tLeft superior gluteal artery: No feeding vessels identified. *\tLeft L5 and L4 lumbar level arteries: No feeding vessels identified.  2. Ultrasound shows large left flank mass representing venous and lymphatic malformations. The lymphatic component of the mass is in the superomedial aspect. The venous component occupies the lateral and inferior aspect.  3. Approximately 200 ml of dark brownish lymphatic malformation fluid was aspirated and sent for lab analysis. Successful core biopsy of the solid component of the malformation.  4. Sclerotherapy\/embolization of the lymphatic component of the malformation was performed using 6 ml of STS foam ( separate 4 ml and 2 ml were injected into the inferior and superior aspects respectively)  5. The Venous malformation component was treated with 18 ml of STS foam. Venogram showed no outflow into systemic circulation.    IMPRESSION:  1. Large left flank venous\/lymphatic malformation. No feeding vessels on aortogram and pelvic angiogram. 2. Sclerotherapy of the malformations were successful performed under ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance. 3. Core biopsy and fluid aspirate were sent for tissue\/lab analysis.  TREATMENT PLAN:  1. Patient will be likely scheduled for additional embolization\/sclerotherapy of left flank malformation in 6-8 weeks with [HCW] with anesthesia support. 2. Start ibuprofen 800 mg every 8 hours starting tonight for days 1-3  3. On days 4-7 take ibuprofen every 8 hours while awake. Pt also sent Rx for percocet as needed 4. Follow-up biopsy results.   TECHNIQUE:  Pelvic Angiogram With the patient in the supine position, the left wrist was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. The left wrist was evaluated with ultrasound and left radial artery patency and acceptable size criteria were documented. Images were properly stored in PACS. A modified Allen test (Barbeau test Type B) was performed on the left wrist to confirm patency of the ulnopalmar arch using pulse oximetry.   1% lidocaine solution was administered for local anesthesia. Access was obtained to the left radial artery using a 21 gauge micro needle and ultrasound guidance. Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. Permanent recording and reporting of the saved image and study into the PACS system was performed. A wire was placed through the needle. A hydrophilic Glidesheath was advanced slowly over the wire. 3000 units of heparin, 200 mcg of nitroglycerin and 2.5 mg of verapamil was given through the arterial sheath with slow hemodilution. A side flush was started.   Diagnostic catheter was advanced through the sheath into the aorta and used to catheterize the left internal iliac arteries, lumbar, left subclavian and pelvic vessels described above. Angiograms were performed. No embolization was performed.  All catheters and wires were removed from the patient. A TR Band was placed on the left wrist for hemostasis.    TECHNIQUE: Venous lymphatic sclerotherapy\/embolization and biopsy Prior to starting procedure, patient was asked to point of areas of maximal pain\/discomfort, these areas were then marked as possible targets for treatment. With the patient in the supine position, the area was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. Under direct ultrasound guidance, a 21-gauge needle was advanced into the targeted area of maximal vessel size of the malformation in the lateral flank. Venogram was then performed, as described above. Embolization\/sclerotherapy was then carried out with Sotradecol 3% solution (3:2:1 air :Sotradecol: lipiodol), as above. Repeat ultrasound demonstrated satisfactory embolization with sclerosing material throughout visualized abnormal veins.   Under direct ultrasound guidance, a 17 gauge needle guide was advanced into solid aspects of the malformation. Images documenting needle access and biopsy course were saved.  Four coaxial passes were made with an 18 gauge biopsy gun. The specimen was placed in formalin.   Under direct ultrasound guidance, access was then obtained into the target area of cystic component in the superior and medial aspect of the malformations. Venogram and fluid aspiration was performed, and was determined to be lymphatic malformation. Embolization\/sclerotherapy was then carried out Sotradecol 3% solution (3:2:1 air :Sotradecol: lipiodol), as above.

This and over collateral venous channels lead to the opacification of the RIJV -there is an unusual, irregularly complex appearing occlusion of the junction of the RSCV and RBCV  -following initial (8- and 12-mm) venoplasty, there is new antegrade flow across the dilated venous segment and significant diminution of flow to the aforementioned collateral venous channels, albeit with significant residual stenotic disease    IVUS evaluation: -pre-stenotic RSCV: minimal and maximal luminal diameter, 9 and 10.6 mm; surface area, 79 mm2 -point of stenosis, RSCV-RBCV junction: minimal and maximal luminal diameter, 5.4 and 6.3 mm; surface area, 26 mm2.

Due to the location of this venous disease, at the thoracic outlet, and the excellent appearing decision was made not to stent, at this time, favoring close clinical and venographic followup   Impression:   1. point of right upper extremity venous occlusion is unexpectedly at the RSCV and not the right axillary vein.  Prior reported point of occlusion can be blamed on a dynamic or functional obstruction related to flow diversion from adjacent, well-formed collateral venous circulation 2. catheter-wire passage across the RSCV-RBCV junctional occlusion 3. treatment of the RSCV-RBCV junctional occlusion\/stenosis, a moderate technical success.   Stent placement deferred, at this time, favoring close clinical and venographic followup.  Calculated fears: excellent appearing antegrade flow; thoracic outlet location of the venous disease; young patient age   Treatment Plan:  1. Patient to be scheduled for 2-3 week venographic re-evaluation + AVM embolization via the RIMA 2. Start oral anticoagulation    Technique:   The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure and sedation were explained.  The specific risks of bleeding, infection, pulmonary embolism, perforation, thrombosis, and need for subsequent procedures\/surgery were detailed and accepted. Written informed consent was obtained. Patient was brought to the procedure suite and a time out was performed prior to procedure initiation. Patient was placed in the supine position and, following sedation, the access sites were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Venous Access:  Sterile technique and sonographic guidance were used to gain 21-g needle access to the right brachial vein.  Exchange was made over an 0.018-in Cope wire for a 5-Fr. micropuncture set.  This afforded 0.035-in Rosen wire exchange for a 6-Fr. x 25-cm introducer sheath, through which contrast examination was performed.  Through the sheath, a 5-Fr. angled catheter was advanced, with the distal tip advanced to immediately adjacent to the point of right subclavian venous (RSCV) occlusion.  Through the catheter, an 0.035-in angled glide wire was advanced and, along with the catheter, was used to probe the aforementioned point of venous occlusion, with eventual traversal of the guide wire.  Sterile technique and sonographic guidance were used to gain 21-g needle access to the right common femoral vein.  Exchange was made over an 0.018-in Cope wire for a 5-Fr. micropuncture set.  This afforded 0.035-in Rosen wire exchange for an 8-Fr. x 65-cm introducer sheath, withe distal tip advanced to the superior most aspect of the superior vena cava (SVC).  Through this, a 6-Fr. 25-mm snare wire was advanced and used to catch the glide wire (from the RBrV approach), then retracted into the sheath.  Via the RBrV approach, exchange was made over the glide wire for a 4-Fr. angled catheter.  This was advanced past the occlusive lesion, and into the RCFV sheath, where exchange was made for a 260-cm Amplatz wire.  This was again caught with the the snare wire, retracted into the sheath, then externalized via the RCFV access.    Through the RBrV sheath, exchange was  made for an 8-Fr. x 25-cm sheath through which an 8-mm balloon catheter was advanced, used to dilate the occlusive right SCV-BCV junction lesion.  Check venography was performed, followed by 12-mm balloon dilatation.  This was followed by formal angiography.  Exchange was then made for an 8-Fr. ([VENDOR]) IVUS catheter, used to interrogate the dilated venous segment.  This same venous segment was then dilated using a 12-mm high pressure ([VENDOR]) balloon catheter, in a prolonged fashion.  Completion venography was then performed.  At the [HOSPITAL], exchange was then made over the indwelling Amplatz wire for a 7-Fr. short introducer sheath.  The latter was then removed with simultaneous deployment of an extra-luminal vascular access closure (Amplatz) device, with manual compression applied to effect hemostasis.   At the [HOSPITAL], a 5-Fr. angled catheter was advanced over the indwelling Amplatz wire, allowing for removal of the latter.  The sheath was then removed, with manual compression applied to effect hemostasis.  A sterile bandage was applied to each venous access site.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

TECHNIQUE:  Pelvic Angiogram With the patient in the supine position, the left wrist was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. The left wrist was evaluated with ultrasound and left radial artery patency and acceptable size criteria were documented. Images were properly stored in PACS. A modified Allen test (Barbeau test Type B) was performed on the left wrist to confirm patency of the ulnopalmar arch using pulse oximetry.   1% lidocaine solution was administered for local anesthesia. Access was obtained to the left radial artery using a 21 gauge micro needle and ultrasound guidance. Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. Permanent recording and reporting of the saved image and study into the PACS system was performed. A wire was placed through the needle. A hydrophilic Glidesheath was advanced slowly over the wire. 3000 units of heparin, 200 mcg of nitroglycerin and 2.5 mg of verapamil was given through the arterial sheath with slow hemodilution. A side flush was started.   Diagnostic catheter was advanced through the sheath into the aorta and used to catheterize the left internal iliac arteries, lumbar, left subclavian and pelvic vessels described above. Angiograms were performed. No embolization was performed.  All catheters and wires were removed from the patient. A TR Band was placed on the left wrist for hemostasis.    TECHNIQUE: Venous lymphatic sclerotherapy\/embolization and biopsy Prior to starting procedure, patient was asked to point of areas of maximal pain\/discomfort, these areas were then marked as possible targets for treatment. With the patient in the supine position, the area was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. Under direct ultrasound guidance, a 21-gauge needle was advanced into the targeted area of maximal vessel size of the malformation in the lateral flank. Venogram was then performed, as described above. Embolization\/sclerotherapy was then carried out with Sotradecol 3% solution (3:2:1 air :Sotradecol: lipiodol), as above. Repeat ultrasound demonstrated satisfactory embolization with sclerosing material throughout visualized abnormal veins.   Under direct ultrasound guidance, a 17 gauge needle guide was advanced into solid aspects of the malformation. Images documenting needle access and biopsy course were saved.  Four coaxial passes were made with an 18 gauge biopsy gun. The specimen was placed in formalin.   Under direct ultrasound guidance, access was then obtained into the target area of cystic component in the superior and medial aspect of the malformations. Venogram and fluid aspiration was performed, and was determined to be lymphatic malformation. Embolization\/sclerotherapy was then carried out Sotradecol 3% solution (3:2:1 air :Sotradecol: lipiodol), as above.

Follow-up cholangiogram in 2 weeks for drain evaluation and possible removal..  Technique:   The existing catheter and surrounding soft tissues were prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Local anesthetic was injected at the catheter entry site. Contrast was injected through the existing catheter, with findings as described above.  An 0.035\" Amplatz wire was negotiated through the catheter into the small bowel. The catheter was removed and exchanged for a 16 French coaxial sheath system. A safety wire was placed descending into the small bowel  An alligator forceps was advanced through the 16 French coaxial system into the proximal aspect of the stent. An attempt was made to retrieve the stent, however, unsuccessful, given the stiff shaft of the forceps and the angle of the biliary tract entry. Alligator forceps were removed, and a 7 French clamshell clamp was advanced through the sheath, again unsuccessful attempt for stone retrieval. During these maneuvers, the proximal end of the stent became kinked and migrated into the small bowel. Subsequently, Spyglass endoscopy was utilized to visualize the stent and clamshell (CoreDx) clamps were used to grab the stent and bring it back to the level of the ampulla.  The stent was unable to be pulled back into the common bile duct, however. The spyglass scope was then removed and a loop snare was advanced through the sheath and used to grab the stent.  The stent and sheath were then successfully removed as a unit.  The stent was successfully removed in its entirety.  The sheath was then reinserted.  Cholangiography was performed demonstrating multiple filling defects through the common bile duct, likely related to blood clots and debris.  A Fogarty balloon was then utilized to sweep the left biliary duct and common bile duct. Follow-up sheath cholangiogram demonstrated persistent mild narrowing of the choledocho choledochal anastomosis with brisk passage of contrast through the biliary system and into the small bowel   The sheath was removed and a new 14 French external biliary drain was placed over the wire.

{"ReportID":7334252,"ContentText_DEID":"CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM AND ENDOVASCULAR PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION OF A RIGHT OPHTHALMIC ARTERY ANEURYSM  CLINICAL INDICATION: 78-year-old female with history of migraines, incidentally discovered right ophthalmic artery and left cavernous internal carotid artery aneurysms in [DATE], who developed symptoms of optic neuropathy on the right, and was planned to have flow diversion treatment with pipeline embolization device. However the size of the parent vessel measured slightly large for the pipeline device at that time, and plan was made to return when the pipeline vantage was available. She also presented to the hospital in [DATE] with symptoms of double vision, and underwent an MRI\/MRA, which when compared to a study in [DATE], showed slight interval enlargement of bilateral aneurysms. She presents today for pipeline embolization of her right ophthalmic artery aneurysm.  PROCEDURE:  1.\tCerebral angiogram  2.\tEndovascular pipeline embolization  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 4.5 hours.  OPERATORS: [HCW]. was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] was the assisting physician. [HCW]. and [HCW] were the fellow. All actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS CATHETERIZED: Right common carotid artery Right internal carotid artery Right common femoral artery  VESSELS TREATED (in sequence): Internal carotid artery  ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia.

Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, stent thrombosis\/stenosis, stent migration, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, non-target embolization, puncture site hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite, intubated, and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery. Through the dilator sheath, an angiogram of the of the right common femoral artery was obtained to ensure the arteriotomy was above the level of the bifurcation and the CFA was of sufficient size to use the 8 French Angio-Seal closure device. An 8 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 5000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement; additional boluses of heparin were administered at one-hour intervals. The ACT was checked to ensure that it was between 250-300. Using fluoroscopic guidance,  the arteries listed above were selectively catheterized. Digital angiograms were performed in the AP, lateral and oblique projections centered over the head and neck.   3D rotational angiography was performed with the long selection catheter in the right internal carotid artery to better delineate the right ophthalmic artery aneurysm. The acquisition was processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.   We then attempted to select the right internal carotid artery using a combination of different wires and selection catheters through the Infinity long sheath. We encountered significant tortuosity at the proximal right common carotid artery. We tried several different combinations, including the 035 Glidewire, the 038 Glidewire, the stiffened Glidewire, and the Glidewire advantage, through several different selection catheters including the penumbra Simmons catheter, the penumbra Sim-V, the Merit performa (both in original shape, and with a steamed tip). We also attempted to turn her head to the left and right to change the angles of turns in the vessels. However after trying many combinations and attempting catheterization for over an hour, we were unable to advance the Infinity long sheath into the common carotid artery via the transfemoral approach and decided to attempt a transradial approach. We closed the right common femoral artery access site using an 8 French Angio-Seal.   Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right radial artery under ultrasound guidance; a 6 French 25 cm slender sheath was introduced into the right radial artery using ultrasound guidance. 200 mcg of nitroglycerin, 2.5 mg of verapamil were administered intra-arterially through the sheath after sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, again attempted to selectively catheterize the right common carotid artery. Due to the severe tortuosity at the origin of the right common carotid artery, we encountered significant difficulty from a radial approach as well. We tried a combination of selection catheters and intermediate catheters and were finally able to obtain some purchase with a 6 French Sofia distal access catheter into the right internal carotid artery.  We were unable to advance the Sofia past the petrous segment without concern of kinking or herniating catheter at the origin of the right common carotid artery. We prepared a hyperform balloon on the back table in the usual fashion and advanced it through the Sofia over the its microwire and inflated the balloon in the petrous segment then client with the Sofia. We then were concerned that advancing the pipeline device through Phenom 27 without more support would cause herniation of the system in the chest, so we advanced a vector 46 through the Sofia, then advanced the Phenom 27 over the Asahi 018 into the M1 segment. We exchanged the microwire for the 5.5 mm x 30 mm pipeline embolization device. The device was deployed under fluoroscopic guidance and a single shot X-ray was performed to confirm that the distal and proximal ends of the pipeline embolization device were in the supraclinoid and right ICA cavernous segment, respectively. Postprocessing of the pipeline embolization device was performed with a curved microwire with successful improvement in apposition of the proximal aspects of the device.  A final AP and Lateral angiogram were completed to evaluate the distal vasculature for perfusion deficits and emboli.   After completion of the procedure, Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a TR Band.  COMPARISON: Cerebral angiogram [DATE].  FINDINGS:  RIGHT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: The distal cervical and intracranial ICA are unremarkable in course and caliber. There is a large medially directed ophthalmic artery aneurysm better described on the 3-D angiogram below. The MCA and ACA branches opacify normally. The ECA branches are visualized and opacify normally. There is no evidence of focal stenosis or early draining vein.  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a large medially directed ophthalmic artery aneurysm best described on the 3-D angiogram below. The MCA and ACA branches opacify normally. There is no evidence of focal stenosis, other aneurysm or early draining vein.   RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION): The Pipeline device is well apposed to the vessel walls throughout it's course without endoleak. . Stasis of contrast is noted within the aneurysm. . No perfusion deficits to suggest distal emboli are present.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY: A 3D rotational angiogram of the  right internal carotid artery was completed and post-processed on an independent work station. 3D angiography revealed a large ophthalmic artery aneurysm measuring approximately 9.5 x 12.4 mm (transverse by transverse).  RIGHT COMMON FEMORAL ARTERY: No abnormalities are detected. The arteriotomy was above the level of the bifurcation and the CFA was of sufficient size to use the 8 French Angio-Seal closure device.   COMPLICATIONS: none immediate.  IMPRESSION:  1.\tSuccessful transradial deployment of a pipeline vantage embolization device in the right internal carotid artery for treatment of a right ophthalmic artery aneurysm, with no evidence of endoleak or in-stent stenosis. 2.\tExtremely significant tortuosity of the proximal right common carotid artery which precluded catheterization from a transfemoral approach.
