{"text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Male Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL].[ID].[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  This is a 76-year-old man with multiple medical problems, including vascular dementia, stroke with right hemiparesis, hypertension, prostate cancer, and aspiration with acute respiratory failure with worsening metabolic encephalopathy who was admitted to the hospital on [DATE] and transferred to the ICU on [DATE] with a GI bleed/hematochezia and hypotension. CT angiogram showed a bleed in the rectum. Thrombocytopenia (18,000 platelets) precluded colonoscopy and he was taken to the IR suite for embolization under anesthesia.  Procedures: Ultrasound and fluoroscopy-guided  peritoneal catheter placement Ultrasound and fluoroscopy-guided pericardial drain placement  Findings: The CT angiogram from 10:40 AM was reviewed  1. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. The left hemidiaphragm is elevated. There is contrast in the left colon. Monitor leads are in place. A CO2 monitor is in the distal esophagus. 2. Ultrasound confirms pericardial fluid. It appears to be of similar amount to that seen on the CT from several hours earlier. 3. The initial 8 French catheter placed aspirated frank blood. Contrast injection confirmed this to be in the peritoneal cavity. Several 100 mL bloody fluid were aspirated and a sample was sent to the lab. 4. Contrast injection of the second catheter confirms pericardial location. 5. Pericardial fluid returned clear yellow. 6. An 8 French pigtail catheter is adequately positioned and the pericardium. A total of 80 mL clear fluid were aspirated.  Impression:   Critically ill patient who experienced cardiac arrest prior to the visceral arteriography initiation.  An 8 French peritoneal catheter was placed, aspirating bloody fluid.  An 8 French pericardial drain aspirated 80 mL clear yellow fluid.    Technique:  The patient was brought to the IR suite in critical condition.  A left radial art line was in place. Since a radial approach was warranted due to severe thrombocytopenia, the left radial art line was exchanged for a 5 French slender technology sheath. Attention was redirected to placement of an material line on the right for monitoring.  Prior to procedure initiation, the patient experienced cardiac arrest. ROSC was achieved. The patient was responding poorly to resuscitative efforts. Due to the presence of ultrasonographic pericardial fluid and poor left ventricular volume, the decision was made to place a pericardial drain.  The anterior chest wall was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. A 21-gauge needle was advanced toward the pericardial fluid under direct ultrasound guidance. Initially, the wire coursed caudal. The catheter was placed and found to be in the peritoneal cavity. Several 100 mL grossly bloody fluid were aspirated.  From a different window, a longer 21-gauge needle was used to access the pericardial space. Ultrasound images confirmed location. Fluid returned was clear yellow. A 0.018 inch wire was placed. The needle was exchanged for a transitional dilator. The smaller wire was replaced with a short Amplatz wire. Contrast injection confirmed pericardial location. The transitional dilator was exchanged for an 8 French pigtail catheter.  The retention loop of this catheter was formed in the pericardium. 80 mL clear yellow fluid were removed.  The patient was found to be in refractory shock and in spite of blood product administration, pericardial drain placement, and massive pressor support, he could not be successfully resuscitated. The procedure was aborted.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Gail Peters Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.

Sequence of events so far:  1. [DATE]      Common bile duct access lost during endoscopic stent exchange   2. [DATE]      PTC with 12 French right internal/external biliary drain placement under GA 3. [DATE]      Biliary drain malpositioned with peritoneal loop. The catheter 12 French was exchanged with moderate sedation 4. [DATE]      A covered stent was placed in the common hepatic and common bile duct under sedation, requiring a large amount of narcotic with poor pain control 5. [DATE]      Today the patient returns for cholangiography for possible drain removal under general anesthesia   PROCEDURE: Catheter cholangiogram and internal/external drain replacement     FINDINGS: Comparison is made to a prior study dated [DATE]. Images from [DATE] and [DATE] were also reviewed..  1.  The scout radiograph shows the internal/external biliary drain appearing appropriately positioned. There is no leakage at the flank. 2 covered stents are visualized in the extrahepatic bile ducts. 2.  Sheath cholangiogram shows narrowing of the common hepatic duct above the central extent of the stent. The bile ducts are decompressed. 3.  There is extrinsic compression by mass from the left toward the right, narrowing the cephalad portion of the common hepatic duct just beyond the biliary confluence. This is seen as a filling defect with injection at the confluence. 4. The hepatic parenchymal tract is mature. 5. There is ongoing fistulous communication of the mass with the duodenum. 6. The newly placed 12 French right internal/external biliary drain is appropriately positioned. The cope loop was removed to prevent suture entanglement with the stents should further exchanges be required.   IMPRESSION:  1.  Interval progression of tumor with extrinsic compression of the common hepatic duct near the biliary confluence. 2.  Uneventful image guided replacement of an internal/external biliary catheter as described. 3. This patient will be catheter dependent from this point forward.   PLAN: 1.  Routine maintenance in 12 weeks. 2.  The patient was asked to go to the emergency room for lower extremity swelling. He declined and states he would rather go to the emergency room near his home in [HOSPITAL].   TECHNIQUE:    The existing catheter and surrounding soft tissues were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.    A 0.035\" glidewire was negotiated through the catheter into the small bowel.  The catheter was removed over the wire and a short 8 French sheath placed. Sheath injection evaluated the biliary tree. Proximal tumor extension was identified with extrinsic compression just beyond the hilum.  A DSA run showed a patent stent with some irregularity and prompt flow into the duodenum. A 5F catheter was placed adjacent to the glide to better delineate the cephalad portion of the common hepatic duct.  A tractogram was performed on sheath withdrawal.  A 12 French internal/external biliary drain with extended sideholes (no standard catheter available) was modified by removing the retention suture and placed over the wire.  Contrast was injected to confirm tube position.  The tube was capped.  The catheter was secured to the skin with 2-0 Ethilon.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications and was discharged still asleep into the care of anesthesiology for transfer to the PACU.

Specifically, the risks of intracranial or systemic hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, distal emboli, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, device malfunction, groin hematoma, arterial dissection/laceration, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite, intubated, and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; an 8 French sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery. The 8 French balloon guide-catheter and diagnostic catheter were introduced into the right common carotid artery as a system. A roadmap angiogram was completed of the common carotid artery to visualize the carotid bifurcation. The diagnostic catheter was then used to select the internal carotid artery over the guidewire. The balloon guide catheter was then advanced into the cervical internal carotid artery over the wire and diagnostic catheter. The wire and diagnostic catheter were then removed and the balloon guide was connected to a continual heparinized saline flush. Digital angiograms were performed centered over the head.   The initial TICI score was 2b secondary to a subocclusive clot in the proximal right M1 segment. Note was made of cervical ICA vasospasm . 5 mg intra-arterial verapamil was infused and a repeat run demonstrated improvement in the previously noted vasospasm.  A triaxial system of the aspiration catheter, microcatheter, and microguidewire were advanced into the internal carotid artery over roadmap guidance. The Trak 21 microcatheter and Asahi 018 microwire were then advanced through the aspiration catheter past the MCA occlusion. A microrun confirmed intravascular placement.  The aspiration catheter was then tracked to the face of the clot. The wire was removed from the microcatheter and replaced with the Trevo NXT 4 x 41 stentriever device.  The stentriever was deployed under fluoroscopy and the allowed to set in the clot for 5 minutes. The microcatheter was removed so that that the stentriever was \"naked\" in the aspiration catheter. The balloon on the guide catheter was then inflated. The stentriever was then removed under continuous aspiration using a 60cc syringe. Thrombus was  identified within the stentriever device.  The balloon on the guide was deflated and a cerebral angiogram was performed through the guide catheter. Recanalization of the MCA was achieved with revascularization of the distal territory consistent with TICI 2c.  An angiogram of the right common femoral artery was obtained; the artery was deemed not appropriate for use of the 8 French Angio-Seal closure device.

Technique:  With the patient in prone position, the bilateral flanks were prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. A scout radiograph was obtained.   A sample was obtained for cytology evaluation.Contrast was then injected through the existing nephroureterostomy tube and imaging of the collecting was system performed. This demonstrated persistent stricture with clogging of the tube in its mid to distal portions. Additionally, a bifid collecting system was noted with normal appearance of the upper and mid pole calyces, and an isolated lower pole pelvis draining separately into the proximal ureter.   A 0.035\" Glidewire advantage was placed through the tube into the bladder and the tube removed over the wire and discarded. An 8 French sheath was then advanced over the wire into the bladder. An additional Amplatz wire was advanced into the bladder as a safety wire.  The new 8 French by 12 cm Cook nephroureteral stent was then advanced over the wire under fluoroscopic guidance, and successfully deployed with the distal loop in the bladder, and the proximal loop in the renal pelvis.  Then over the Amplatz safety wire, a new 8 French nephrostomy tube was advanced with cope loop formed in the renal pelvis. It took quite a bit of maneuvering to appropriately position the newly placed PCN and JJ stent, however at the end of the procedure both were adequately positioned with contrast flowing through the stent into the bladder.

CT head revealed diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and CTA demonstrated an anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Diagnostic cerebral angiogram and treatment of ruptured aneurysm is indicated.  PROCEDURE: Cerebral angiogram, coil embolization of an anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: 2 hours.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician.  He supervised the entire procedure. [HCW] and [HCW] were the fellows. Each actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS CATHETERIZED: Right external carotid artery Right internal carotid artery Right vertebral artery Left internal carotid artery Left external carotid artery Right anterior cerebral artery Anterior communicating artery  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right common femoral artery Right external carotid artery Right internal carotid artery Right vertebral artery Left internal carotid artery Left external carotid artery   VESSELS TREATED (in sequence): Anterior communicating artery  ANESTHESIA:   General Anesthesia administered by anesthesiology staff.  Pre- Intra- and post- anesthesia records are available in the patient chart.

Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, hemorrhage, renal failure, limb loss, death, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.  After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion after intubation by the anesthesiology team. Access to the vascular system was gained by a single-wall puncture of the right common femoral artery. An angiogram of the right common femoral artery was performed through the outer cannula the dilator in order to ensure appropriate location of the arteriotomy and suitability of the artery for use of closure device. A 6 French short sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery  using Seldinger technique. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously. Using fluoroscopic guidance, the 5 French diagnostic catheter was used to select the bilateral internal carotid arteries and the left vertebral artery.  Digital angiograms were performed of these vessels, centered over the head. Ipsilateral and contralateral oblique projections were obtained of both internal carotid artery injections to evaluate for anterior communicating or MCA bifurcation aneurysms.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the mid cervical segment of the right internal carotid artery for better delineation of the intracranial vasculature. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.  Following the diagnostic angiogram, an aspirin rectal suppository (300 mg) and an additional 2000 units of heparin IV were administered in preparation for coiling. A CTs were checked and additional heparin boluses were administered as needed in order to maintain an ACT between 250 and 300. The 6 French short Terumo sheath was exchanged over a Bentson wire for a 6 French 65 cm arrow long sheath. The diagnostic catheter and Bentson guidewire were advanced through the arrow sheath and used to select the right internal carotid artery. The arrow sheath was advanced into the right common carotid artery. The diagnostic catheter and Bentson guidewire were removed. The Sofia guide catheter was advanced over the Terumo Glidewire through the error sheath, and under roadmap guidance was advanced into the right internal carotid artery just proximal to the tonsillar loop. The Terumo Glidewire was withdrawn.  The balloon was then prepared on an adjacent table, and the microguidewire and the balloon were passed coaxially through the guide catheter into the 6 French Sofia catheter. The microcatheter and microwire and Hyperform balloon were advanced past the cervical into the ascending petrous portion of the right internal carotid artery. The Sofia catheter was advanced over these into the petrous segment of the right ICA. We attempted to advance the Hyperform balloon into the ACA, but was difficult to push and there seemed to be friction with the headway catheter. It was therefore removed and replaced with a scepter xc balloon which was advanced into the right ACA and positioned over the neck of the aneurysm without difficulty. Superselective catheterization of the anterior communicating artery aneurysm performed with the microcatheter over a microguidewire.   The aneurysm was framed and filled with the aforementioned coils using roadmap and blank roadmap technique. After the first several coils were placed within the aneurysm we withdrew the microcatheter from the aneurysm and reaccessed the aneurysm in order to more completely fill the aneurysm. The balloon was left in place in case of aneurysm rupture, but was not inflated during the case.   A final cerebral angiogram was done in the AP and lateral projection to evaluate for residual filling, and distal emboli.  Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Ancef was administered.  Hemostasis was achieved by application of a Perclose ProGlide. A Tegaderm was then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: None.  FINDINGS: RIGHT COMMON FEMORAL ARTERY: The arteriotomy is above the bifurcation of the right common femoral artery and the diameter of the vessel is adequate for a Perclose ProGlide.  RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a saccular aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery, the dimensions of which are described on 3-D rotational angiogram discussed below. No other aneurysms are identified. There is a tortuous tonsillar loop. No focal stenosis or early draining vein are identified.   RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Reflux of contrast into the  left vertebral artery was achieved. The origin of PICA is normal bilaterally.   LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Again there is seen a tortuous tonsillar loop.  LEFT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-EMBOLIZATION): There is a dense coil pack within the body of the aneurysm with no appreciable ongoing contrast opacification within the aneurysm. There are no perfusion deficits to suggest distal emboli in the distal circulation.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE right internal carotid artery:  3-D rotational angiography demonstrated a lobulated, narrow neck anterior communicating artery aneurysm which measures 7.8 x 7.6 x 6.7 x 2.9 mm (axial by axial by neck-to-dome by neck). This is the source of the patient's subarachnoid hemorrhage.    COMPLICATIONS: None.  IMPRESSION: 1. There is a lobulated, narrow neck anterior communicating artery aneurysm which measures 7.8 x 7.6 x 6.7 x 2.9 mm (axial by axial by neck-to-dome by neck). This is the source of the patient's subarachnoid hemorrhage. 2. Successful coil embolization of the above aneurysm with dense coil pack and no evidence of ongoing aneurysmal filling. 3. No other aneurysms were identified 4. Bilateral tonsillar loops of the internal carotid arteries."}

Right inferior pole segmental artery: Tumoral blush identified. No active extravasation. Post-embolization right renal inferior pole segmental artery angiography: Nonopacification of tumor blush.  Transcatheter embolization: Vessel 1: Right renal inferior pole segmental renal artery Embolic: Ethanol/lipiodol Details (type/size/volume/number):  1:1 ratio ethanol:lipiodol Total 0.7 cc delivered  IMPRESSION:   1.\tTechnically successful ethanol embolization of tumor blush supplied by the right renal inferior pole artery. 2.\tNo angiographic findings of active arterial bleeding, arteriovenous fistula, or pseudoaneurysm in the right kidney.  TREATMENT PLAN:  1. Continued clinical and laboratory monitoring recommended. Please contact interventional radiology if there is a change in clinical status. 2. Extended TR band protocol. To be removed in 2 hours. Left-hand neurovascular checks Q1 hours for 4 hours.  3. Plan to discuss a followup ablation of known renal mass in IR clinic.  TECHNIQUE:  With the patient in the supine position, the left wrist was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. The left wrist was evaluated with ultrasound and appropriate left radial artery access criteria were documented. A modified Allen test (Barbeau test) was performed on the left wrist to confirm patency of the ulnopalmar arch using pulse oximetry (Barbeau B).  1% lidocaine solution was administered for local anesthesia. Access was obtained to the left radial artery using a 21 gauge needle and ultrasound guidance,. Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. Permanent recording and reporting of the saved image and study into the PACS system was performed. A wire was placed through the needle. A hydrophilic Glidesheath was advanced slowly over the wire. 3000 units of heparin, 200 mcg of nitroglycerin and 2.5 mg of verapamil was given through the arterial sheath with slow hemodilution. A side flush was started.   A 5-Fr RAVI MG1 catheter was advanced over an 0.035\" Bentson wire into the aorta. The catheter was used to catheterize the right renal artery as detailed above. Multiple angiograms were performed both from the main renal artery, and subselective interlobar renal arteries. No active extravasation, pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula identified. The right inferior pole segmental artery was then subselectively catheterized using a 2.4 Progreat microcatheter/Asahi Meister microwire combination.   Angiogram was performed from the microcatheter which demonstrated tumor blush. The above embolization was then performed. A postembolization angiogram demonstrated no further flow to the tumor. This same microcatheter/microwire combination was then used to subselectively catheterize any remaining interlobar arteries, without any abnormality identified.  An upward going capsular branch arising from the main renal artery was then catheterized, and angiogram again demonstrated no active extravasation or abnormality.   All catheters and wires were removed from the patient. A band was placed on the left wrist for hemostasis. The access sheath was removed, and a developing hematoma was noted proximally to the TR band (up on the forearm). An additional large TR band was attempted to be applied over the hematoma, however unsuccessful. Coban wrap was then used to wrap the forearm. Radial pulse was still palpable, with preserved waveform and oxygen readings.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition.

{"text": "DIAGNOSTIC CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM, POSSIBLE PREOPERATIVE TUMOR EMBOLIZATION  CLINICAL INDICATION: This is a 31 years Male who developed left eye blurry vision no evidence found to have a large sphenoid wing mass. He is now planned to undergo surgical resection and presents for diagnostic cerebral angiography and possible tumor position.   PROCEDURE: Diagnostic cerebral angiogram, possible preoperative tumor embolization  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 60 minutes.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] and [HCW] were the fellow. [HCW] was the resident.  Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right internal carotid artery Right external carotid artery Left internal carotid artery Left external carotid artery Left vertebral artery Left ascending pharyngeal artery  ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia was administered under the supervision of the attending anesthesiologist. Pre-, intra-, and post-anesthesia monitoring records are available in the chart.  MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Heparin 3000 units IV Protamine 20 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter  Headway 17 advanced straight microcatheter Transend-EX microguidewire Omnipaque-300 contrast material (80 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   After reviewing the angiograms, we identified that the tumor supply was predominantly via the bilateral internal carotid arteries without safe target that would result in a high field embolization. We selectively catheterize the left ascending pharyngeal artery using a headway 17 microcatheter over the transcend microguidewire. We performed an angiogram of the left ascending pharyngeal artery. The left ascending pharyngeal artery supplied a very minor portion of the tumor and it was felt that embolization of this branch would not result in a significant decrease in tumor blush overall. At this point the procedure was concluded.  Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a 5 French Vascade closure device  followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Noninvasive imaging.  FINDINGS: RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. There is a tumor blush present, supplied primarily by the meningohypophyseal trunk of the right internal carotid artery.  RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula. No tumor blush is present.  LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. There is a large hypervascular tumor blush present, centered at the left sphenoid wing, supplied predominantly by the inferolateral trunk of the left internal carotid artery.  LEFT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula. There is a small amount of tumor blush supplied by the ascending pharyngeal artery.  LEFT ASCENDING PHARYNGEAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a small amount of tumor blush supplied by a distal superior pharyngeal branch of the left ascending pharyngeal artery.  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Reflux of contrast into the contralateral vertebral artery was achieved. The origin of PICA is normal bilaterally. No tumor blush is present.  COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: 1. There is a large hypervascular tumor centered at the left sphenoid wing supplied predominantly by the inferolateral trunk of the left internal carotid artery, with additional supply from the meningohypophyseal trunk of the right internal carotid artery and the left ascending pharyngeal artery. No targets for safe and high yield embolization were identified."}

{"text": "CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM AND ENDOVASCULAR PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION OF A RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY ANEURYSM  CLINICAL INDICATION: 61-year-old gentleman with a history of tobacco use and an incidentally discovered right vertebral artery aneurysm which was first noted on evaluation for a transient episode of global amnesia. Given the size and location of the aneurysm, as well as the patient's age and health status, treatment is indicated.  PROCEDURE:  1.\tCerebral angiogram  2.\tEndovascular pipeline embolization  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 1.5 hours.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] and [HCW] were the fellows. Each actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS CATHETERIZED: Right vertebral artery  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right radial artery (roadmap) Right subclavian artery Right vertebral artery  VESSELS TREATED (in sequence): Right vertebral artery  ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. Pre-, intra-, and post-anesthesia monitoring records are available in the chart.  MEDICATIONS:  Nitropaste Heparin 5000 units (1000 units IA - right radial artery, 4000 units IV) Nitroglycerin 200 mcg IA (right radial artery) Verapamil 2.5 mg IA (right radial artery)   MATERIALS:  6 French Terumo slender sheath with introducer kit 0.035\" Terumo Glidewire (180 cm) 5 French Sofia guide catheter (115 cm) Phenom 27 microcatheter (150 cm) Asahi 018 microguidewire (200 cm) 6 mm x 20 mm pipeline vantage embolization device TR band Omnipaque-300 contrast (100 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, stent thrombosis/stenosis, stent migration, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, non-target embolization, puncture site hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite, intubated, and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Ultrasound evaluation of the right radial artery was performed prior to prepping and draping. The radial artery was visualized using ultrasound from the distal wrist to its origin. The radial artery was patent throughout it's course from the wrist with origin from the brachial artery. Prior to prepping a small amount of Nitropaste was applied over the course of the radial artery on the distal wrist. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right radial artery under ultrasound guidance. The introducer wire was visualized within the radial artery using ultrasound. The course of the introducer wire was also visualized using fluoroscopy. Once we were satisfied that the introducer wire was well positioned within the radial and brachial artery, the 6 French Terumo slender sheath was advanced into the right radial artery over the introducer wire. Through the Terumo slender sheath, a roadmap angiogram of the of the right radial artery was obtained to evaluate for radiolucent and to ensure that there are no problems with the access site. A radial \"cocktail\" of 1000 units of heparin, 200 mcg of nitroglycerin, and 2.5 mg of verapamil were administered slowly through the Terumo slender sheath into the right radial artery. An additional 4000 units of heparin were administered IV. ACT checks were performed and additional heparin boluses were administered as needed in order to achieve a ACT of 250-300.  The 5 French Sofia catheter over a Terumo Glidewire were advanced through the radial sheath, and under fluoroscopic guidance were advanced into the proximal subclavian artery. An angiogram of the right subclavian artery was performed ordered to visualize the origin of the right vertebral artery. Using fluoroscopic guidance the vertebral artery was selected using the Terumo Glidewire, and the Sofia catheter was advanced over the Terumo Glidewire into the distal V2 segment of the right vertebral artery. Digital angiograms were performed in the AP and lateral projections centered over the head and neck.   3D rotational angiography was performed with the Sofia catheter in the distal V2 segment of the right vertebral artery to better delineate the intracranial vasculature. The acquisition was processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.   A working projection was obtained to best demonstrate the neck of the right vertebral artery aneurysm, as well as, the distal and proximal landing zones for the stent. Superselective catheterization of the distal vertebral artery was performed with the Phenom 27 microcatheter over the Asahi 18 microguidewire. The tip of the microguidewire was situated in the distal V4 segment of the right vertebral. The microguidewire in the phenom catheter was then exchanged for a 6 mm x 20 mm pipeline embolization device. The device was deployed under fluoroscopic guidance and a single shot X-ray was performed to confirm that the distal and proximal ends of the pipeline embolization device were in the right vertebral artery, just proximal to the origin of the anterior spinal artery and the V3 segment, respectively. Postprocessing of the pipeline embolization device was not needed.  A final AP and Lateral angiogram were completed to evaluate the distal vasculature for perfusion deficits and emboli.   After completion of the procedure, the sheath was removed and hemostasis obtained using a TR band.  COMPARISON: Angiograms dated 9/18/2023 and 7/24/2023.  FINDINGS:  RIGHT SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY: The origin of the vertebral artery, mammillary artery, and thyrocervical and costocervical trunks are visualized. The aneurysm of the V4 segment of the right vertebral artery is better visualized on the dedicated vertebral artery runs discussed below. Otherwise, the course and caliber of the the visualized portions of these vessels and their branches are normal in course and caliber.  RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: Grossly unchanged right vertebral artery aneurysm which arises just distal to the origin of the PICA. The anterior spinal artery originates from the right vertebral artery distal to the aneurysm.    RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION): There is a small region along the inferior aspect of the midportion of the stent as it crosses over the turn in the vertebral artery that is not quite apposed to the artery. The Pipeline device is otherwise well apposed to the vessel walls throughout it's course. The device does not cover the origin of the anterior spinal artery. Stasis of contrast is noted within the aneurysm. . No perfusion deficits to suggest distal emboli are present.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY: A 3D rotational angiogram of the  right vertebral artery was completed and post-processed on an independent work station. 3D angiography revealed grossly stable wide necked aneurysm of the vertebral artery which originates just distal to and separate from the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. This imaging was obtained primarily for acquisition of appropriate treatment views as well as sizing of device.   COMPLICATIONS: none immediate.  IMPRESSION:  1.\tGrossly stable widening aneurysm of the right vertebral artery which originates just distal to but separate from the PICA. 2.\tSuccessful placement of pipeline vantage embolization device in the right vertebral artery covering the above aneurysm with resulting contrast stagnation within the aneurysm."}

A nephroureteral catheter was placed on [DATE]. The patient comes for conversion back to a nephrostomy tube.   Findings: Comparison is made to a previous exam dated [DATE].  1. Scout radiograph shows a right nephroureteral catheter with both cope loops in their expected location. 2. Contrast injection and wire passage confirmed occlusion of the distal 10 cm of the nephroureteral catheter. 3. The drain was severely encrusted. 4. With great difficulty, the catheter was removed intact. 5. Catheter injection once the catheter was retracted into the mid ureter showed irregularity of the entire ureter but prompt drainage to the bladder. 6. An 8.5 French nephrostomy tube has its cope loop in the renal pelvis.  Impression:   Difficult but successful image-guided conversion of a severely encrusted right nephroureteral catheter to an 8.5 French nephrostomy tube as described above.  Plan:  Flush catheter b.i.d.  Routine change in 8-10 week. The crystals and encrusted catheter was sent to the lab for stone analysis.  Technique:  The existing catheter and surrounding soft tissues were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  A scout radiograph was obtained.   Right nephroureteral tube PCN conversion:  Non-ionic contrast was injected through the existing right nephroureteral catheter and images of the collecting system obtained.  A 0.035\u201d glide wire was advanced through the existing right nephroureteral catheter. The wire could not be negotiated out the end of the catheter. It did come out a sidehole and was easily advanced and looped in the bladder. With resistance, the distal cope loop was unformed old at the UVJ.  Attempt at placing a long 9 French peel-away sheath was unsuccessful as the peel-away buckled in the soft tissues. It did, however, disrupt the mature tract.  Substantial traction was needed to remove the encrusted catheter. Once the wire had been delivered at the skin, attempts were made to remove particulate in the distal portion of the catheter; however, the catheter could not be cleared. Ultimately, the PCNU was removed intact. The occluded catheter and crystals were sent to the lab for analysis.  A new 8.5 F nephrostomy catheter was advanced over the wire and the Cope loop formed in the renal pelvis.  Contrast injection confirmed location.

VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right Internal Carotid Artery Right External Carotid Artery Left Common Carotid Artery Left Subclavian Artery   ANESTHESIA: Local in the right groin with bupivacaine. Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by the nurse present during the entire procedure. The patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Sedation was administered by a specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for the duration of the procedure as outlined above (Total intra service time, 30min ). Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.   MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Versed 1 mg IV Fentanyl 50 mcg IV Heparin 3000 units IV Protamine 20 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter  5 French Simmons 3 Glide catheter  Cardiva Vascade Visipaque-270 contrast material (120 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the right internal carotid artery for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Vascade followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Noninvasive imaging.  FINDINGS:  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a 4.6 x 4.8 x 4.1 mm medially directed anterior communicating artery aneurysm which fills predominantly from the right A1 segment of the ACA. The bilateral ACA branches fill from the right A1. The right internal carotid artery and its segments are normal course and caliber. The right posterior communicating artery is dominant supplies the posterior cerebral artery territory. The MCA and its branches are normal course and caliber. There is normal cortical venous drainage.   RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Reflux of contrast into the contralateral vertebral artery was not achieved. The origin of PICA is normal unilaterally (we will defer to CTA for evaluation of the contralateral PICA). This run is limited by the distal location of the catheter with poor contrast opacification.  LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a mildly hypoplastic left A1 segment of the ACA with brief visualization of the anterior communicating artery aneurysm. The left posterior communicating artery is dominant supplies the posterior cerebral territory. The segments of the left internal carotid artery are normal course and caliber. The MCA and its branches are normal course and caliber. There are normal cortical venous drainage  LEFT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally.

{"text": "CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM AND WOVEN ENDOBRIDGE (WEB) EMBOLIZATION OF BASILAR APEX ANEURYSM    CLINICAL INDICATION: 54-year-old female with past medical history of hypertension, sickle cell disease and multiple incidentally discovered intracranial aneurysms including a right M1 segment aneurysm, a right MCA bifurcation aneurysm, and a right SCA aneurysm for which she previously underwent right-sided orbitozygomatic craniotomy and clip ligation in [DATE]. She also has a basilar apex aneurysm which is indicated.   PROCEDURE: Cerebral angiogram, Woven Endobridge device embolization of basilar apex aneurysm.  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: 4 hours.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician.  He supervised the entire procedure. [HCW] and [HCW] were the fellows. Each actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS CATHETERIZED: Left vertebral artery Basilar artery  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right subclavian artery Right common femoral artery Left vertebral artery Left subclavian artery  VESSELS TREATED (in sequence): Basilar artery  ANESTHESIA:   General Anesthesia administered by anesthesiology staff.  Pre- Intra- and post- anesthesia records are available in the patient chart.   MEDICATIONS GIVEN:  Verapamil 2.5 mg intra-arterial into the right radial artery Nitroglycerin 200 mcg intra-arterial into the right radial artery Heparin 1000 units into the right radial artery Heparin 4000 units IV Ancef 2 gram IV  MATERIALS USED:  6 French Terumo slender sheath, long 5 French micropuncture kit Cope mandrel wire 5 French transitional dilator 6 French 65cm Arrow sheath 0.035\" Bentson guidewire 0.035\" Terumo glidewire (180 cm) 5 French Merit Performa Vertebral catheter 5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter 6 French Sofia guide catheter, 115 cm 5 French Sofia guide catheter, 115 cm  VIA 17 microcatheter (156 cm) Asahi 014 microguidewire (200 cm) Omnipaque 300 contrast material (180 cc) 6 French AngioSeal closure device  DEVICE IMPLANTED: Woven Endobridge SL 7 mm x 4 mm  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, hemorrhage, renal failure, limb loss, death, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.  After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion after intubation by the anesthesiology team.   Initial access to the vascular system was via the right radial artery. A right radial artery line and replaced by anesthesia staff. Through the pre-existing right radial catheter a guidewire was introduced and the radial artery line catheter was exchanged for a 6 French slender Terumo sheath. A radial cocktail consisting of 2.5 mg of verapamil, 200 mcg of nitroglycerin, and 1000 units of heparin was given slowly via the radial sheath. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the 5 French merit Performa vertebral catheter was advanced over the 150 cm baby J Glidewire. A roadmap angiogram of the right subclavian was performed. There is evident from this roadmap angiogram that the V2 segment of the right vertebral artery was significantly more tortuous than head appeared on the CT angiogram. Given this we decided to abandon the approach from the right vertebral artery and therefore the right radial approach in favor of a left vertebral artery approach via femoral access.  Access to the vascular system was gained by a single-wall puncture of the right common femoral artery. An angiogram of the right common femoral artery was performed through the outer cannula the dilator to confirm that the arteriotomy was an appropriate location in adequate for use of appropriate closure device. A 6 French 65cm Arrow sheath was introduced into the descending aortausing Seldinger technique and fluoroscopic guidance.  Using fluoroscopic guidance, the 5 French selection catheter was advanced through the arrow sheath to select the left subclavian artery and left vertebral artery.  The arrow sheath was then advanced over the selection catheter into the left subclavian artery. Digital angiogram was performed, centered over the head.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY: Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the proximal to mid V2 segment of the left vertebral artery for better delineation of the intracranial vasculature. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.  Following the diagnostic angiogram, the 5 French diagnostic catheter was withdrawn.  Through the long sheath, a 6 French Sofia guide catheter was advanced into the left vertebral artery over the VIA 17 microcatheter and Asahi 014 microguidewire. However we were unable to advance the microcatheter and microguidewire beyond the proximal V3 segment for the 072 Navien guide catheter beyond the mid to distal V2 segment due to the tortuosity of the V2 segment of the left vertebral artery. We therefore removed the 6 French Sofia guide catheter and the microcatheters. Were ultimately able to advance and 5 French Sofia guide catheter over a Terumo Glidewire into the proximal V3 segment of the left vertebral artery.   Superselective catheterization of the basilar artery aneurysm was then performed with the VIA 17 microcatheter over a Asahi 014 microguidewire. The WEB SL 7 mm x 4 mm device was then deployed inside of the aneurysm using roadmap and blank roadmap technique.   A final cerebral angiogram was done in the AP and lateral projection to evaluate for residual filling, and distal emboli.  Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine.  An angiogram of the right common femoral artery was obtained to confirm that the arterial puncture was above the bifurcation that the vessels of adequate size to use a 8 French AngioSeal. Ancef was administered.  Hemostasis was achieved by application of a 8 French AngioSeal. A Tegaderm was then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: None.  FINDINGS: RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CERVICAL (ROADMAP): This run was done primarily for navigation and selection of the right vertebral artery and is of limited diagnostic utility. Within those confines, there is severe tortuosity of the V2 segment of the right vertebral artery.  RIGHT COMMON FEMORAL ARTERY: The arteriotomy is above the bifurcation of the right common femoral artery and the diameter of the vessel is adequate for a 6 French AngioSeal.  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CERVICAL (ROADMAP): This run was done primarily for navigation and selection of the left vertebral artery and is of limited diagnostic utility. Within those confines, there is also severe tortuosity of the V2 segment of the right vertebral artery, albeit less than was visualized on the right. Additionally the caliber of the left vertebral artery is significantly larger than that of the right vertebral artery.  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a posteriorly projecting basilar apex aneurysm which is grossly unchanged from prior angiogram, the dimensions of which are described on the 3-D rotational angiography discussed below. There is a surgical clip seen in the expected location of the previously seen superior cerebellar artery aneurysm. No visualized recurrence or residual superior cerebellar artery aneurysm.  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-WOVEN ENDOBRIDGE DEVICE DEPLOYMENT): There is a Web device deployed within the basilar apex aneurysm. There is good apposition to the walls of the aneurysm, especially at the base, without evidence of endoleak. There is significant contrast stagnation within the dome of the aneurysm. The bilateral P1 segments appear patent and fill without delay. There are no perfusion deficits to suggest distal emboli in the posterior circulation.  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CERVICAL: No evidence of dissection post catheterization of the left vertebral artery.  LEFT SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY, CERVICOTHORACIC: No evidence of dissection or stenosis of the origin of the left vertebral artery post catheterization.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  3-D rotational angiography demonstrated posteriorly directed basilar apex aneurysm which measures 5.7 x 6.2 x 5.6 x 2.3 mm (axial by axial by neck-to-dome by neck) which is grossly stable in appearance compared to prior.    IMPRESSION: 1.\tSuccessful deployment of WEB device within unruptured basilar apex aneurysm with maintained patency of the bilateral PCAs. 2.\tNo evidence of recurrence or residual previously ligated superior cerebellar artery aneurysm"}

The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of a peel-away sheath.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   At this point during the procedure the patient's oxygen saturation began to decrease into the 60s and 70s. A code met was called and patient was reversed using the Narcan. After reversal and treatment with nonrebreather patient's oxygen saturation returned to 98%. Patient was an alert and oriented moving extremities.  After the code met was called, the area was reprepped. The catheter was tested however neither port was able to be aspirated. Catheter was exchanged over the wire for a new catheter which functioned properly.  The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.

{"text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Female Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL]  ESRC.[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  Breast cancer status post bilateral mastectomy. Patient with recurrent chylous leak. Prior lymphangiogram without thoracic duct leak, no embolization performed. Patient underwent thorascopic thoracic duct ligation, with persistent chylous leak.  PROCEDURE:   1. Lymphangiogram. 2. Accessory thoracic duct embolization. 3. Direct cisterna chyle leak embolization.   FINDINGS:  1. No thoracic duct opacification, in keeping with prior surgical ligation.  2. Access into an accessory thoracic duct, without evidence of leak. Successfully embolized with glue (1:1 glue:Lipiodol, 2 cc).  3. Direct access into leak originating at this cisterna chyle, successfully embolized with glue (1:2 glue:Lipiodol, 3 cc).  IMPRESSION:   Technically successful accessory thoracic duct and cisterna chyle glue embolization.  TREATMENT PLAN:  Monitor chest tube drain output, and follow-up with cardiothoracic surgery.   TECHNIQUE:  With the patient in the supine position, the bilateral groins and wide abdomen was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier.   A scout radiograph demonstrated lipiodol staining in the bilateral groins from prior lymphangiogram.  Ultrasound evaluation of bilateral groins demonstrated very few scant, normal-appearing lymph nodes. A small lymph node in the right groin was accessed using a 25-gauge spinal needle, and lipiodol was injected. Under fluoroscopic visualization, lipiodol was seen transiting up the iliac chain. Evaluation of the left groin without any appropriate lymph node target lipiodol injection.  A lymph node in the left iliac chain was then targeted under direct fluoroscopic guidance and accessed using a 21-gauge Chiba needle. More lipiodol was injected, and transitted up the iliac chain to the abdominal lymph nodes.  Intermittent fluoroscopy demonstrated transit of the lipiodol through the abdominal lymphatic network to cisterna chyle, however no lipiodol was seen transiting up into the chest. The cisterna chyle, was then directly accessed using a 21-gauge Chiba needle under fluoroscopic guidance. Lipiodol injection demonstrated mild lipiodol opacification and transit up into the chest however no dominant intrathoracic lymphatic duct or definite intrathoracic leak could be identified. A V18 wire was able to be navigated into an accessory thoracic duct into the chest. Cone beam CT confirmed positioning of the wire in this duct, without evidence of leak. The thoracic duct (known location from prior lymphangiogram), could not be identified, in keeping with the patient's known history of thoracic duct ligation.  Attention was then turned to the patient's neck, where we attempted to access the venolymphatic junction deep to the left internal jugular vein, however multiple attempts were unsuccessful, and these attempts were aborted.  We then reviewed the images obtained point extensively, that even before early injections of the cisterna chyle, lipiodol appeared to be leaking towards the right upper quadrant/right lower chest. Cone beam CT was then performed, and lipiodol was confirmed in the right pleural space, indicating that this truly was the site of leak.   The 21-gauge Chiba needle was then used to access a lymph node one vertebral body lower than the cisterna chyle, and glue was injected to this lymph node (with some retrograde flow noted down the abdominal lymphatic chain). The needle was then used to access the confirmed leak near its neck adjacent to the cisterna chyle. More glue was injected, under direct fluoroscopic evaluation, and lipiodol was seen within the chest tube.  At the end of the procedure all needles and wires were removed from the patient's body. The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition without any immediate postprocedural complications.

DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 30 minutes.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] was the fellow. Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Left internal carotid artery  ANESTHESIA: Local in the right groin with bupivacaine. Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by the nurse present during the entire procedure. The patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Sedation was administered by a specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 30 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Heparin 3000 units IV Protamine 20 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.035\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Boston [VENDOR] sheath 5 French Simmons 3 Glide catheter  Mynx Closure Device Visipaque-270 contrast material (40 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the [VENDOR]mons catheter in the left internal carotid artery for better delineation of the anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Mynx closure device followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Cerebral angiogram dated March 20, 2023.  FINDINGS:  LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a coil mass at the site of the previously treated anterior communicating artery aneurysm. There is a small amount of coil compaction and residual aneurysm neck, better described on the 3-D angiogram below. This appears grossly stable compared to prior. There is no focal stenosis or early draining vein  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated recurrent anterior communicating artery aneurysm neck, measuring approximately 2.6 x 3.7 millimeters (dome-to-neck by neck).  COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: 1. There is a recurrent anterior communicating artery aneurysm neck, measuring approximately 2.6 x 3.7 millimeters (dome to neck by neck). This appears stable compared to prior angiogram based on the 2-D images.     Frank C Tong, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance."}

All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).   Ultrasound evaluation of the left basilic vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS. Local anesthetic was used over the access site. Under ultrasound guidance, the left basilic vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS.    A 0.018\" wire was passed centrally and the needle exchanged for a dilator peel-away combination. The wire was used to determine catheter length, and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line cut to appropriate length. The tailored catheter was advanced through the peel-away and positioned centrally using fluoroscopy.   The peel-away was removed, and hemostasis achieved with manual compression. The catheter was aspirated, flushed, and locked per protocol. It was secured in place with Ethilon.  An antimicrobial disc and sterile dressing were applied.  Technique Drain:  Target: Left groin collection Imaging: US+CT Drain: 10.2 Fr Cook Drainage: 1-2 mL bloody fluid aspirated during procedure Microbiology: Sample sent  A superficial skin entry site was selected based on available imaging and the overlying skin entry site was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier to target the above collection. The skin surface was anesthetized with 1-2% lidocaine. Using continuous real-time grayscale and/or color doppler ultrasound guidance, a needle was introduced into the target site and imaging guidance confirmed adequate positioning. The access device was utilized with an 0.035\" wire to introduce the drainage catheter listed above following any necessary serial dilatation. Ultrasound images confirmed appropriate positioning within the target structure. The catheter was secured to the skin surface using nonabsorbable suture material and dressed in typical fashion. Any samples not sent to laboratory for analysis were discarded. Given minimal output the drain was cut and removed.The patient tolerated the procedure and was sent to the recovery area for monitoring.

Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by the nurse present during the entire procedure. The patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Sedation was administered by a specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for the duration of the procedure as outlined above (Total intra service time, 45 min ). Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Versed 1 mg IV Fentanyl 25 mcg IV Heparin 3000 units IV Protamine 20 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 5 French Cordis vert catheter  Cardiva Vascade Visipaque contrast material (110 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the right internal carotid artery for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Vascade followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: None.  FINDINGS: RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a large right MCA bifurcation aneurysm, better described on the 3-D angiogram below. There is no focal stenosis or early draining vein identified.   RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified.   LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The cervical and intracranial ICA, MCA, and ACA branches do not demonstrate any aneurysm or focal stenosis. The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Reflux of contrast into the contralateral vertebral artery was not achieved. The origin of PICA is normal on the left.   RIGHT INNOMINATE ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm is identified arising from the right PICA. The previously described MCA bifurcation aneurysm is again visualized. No other new aneurysms are visualized. There is no focal stenosis or early draining vein.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated a 6.0 x 6.2 x 7.5 x 5.5 mm (transverse by transverse by dome to neck by neck) right MCA bifurcation aneurysm.   COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: 1. There is a 6.0 x 6.2 x 7.5 x 5.5 mm (transverse by transverse by dome to neck by neck) right MCA bifurcation aneurysm.

{"text": "DIAGNOSTIC CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM  CLINICAL INDICATION: This is a 66 years Male with past medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, tobacco use, who presented in [DATE] with perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage. An angiogram at that time was negative. Patient now presents for 3-month diagnostic cerebral angiography    PROCEDURE: Diagnostic cerebral angiogram.  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 45 minutes.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] was the fellow. Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right internal carotid artery Right external carotid artery Left internal carotid artery Left external carotid artery Left vertebral artery  ANESTHESIA: Local in the right groin with bupivacaine. Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by the nurse present during the entire procedure. The patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Sedation was administered by a specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for the duration of the procedure as outlined above (Total intra service time, 45 minutes). Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Versed 1 mg IV Fentanyl 50 mcg IV Heparin 3000 units IV Protamine 20 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter  5 French Vascade closure device Visipaque-270 contrast material (80 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the left internal carotid artery for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a 5 French Vascade closure device  followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Cerebral angiogram November 20, 2023.  FINDINGS: RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. There is mild intracranial atherosclerotic disease at the cavernous and supraclinoid internal carotid artery segments.  RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No new aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. The previously seen medially directed outpouching just proximal to the ophthalmic segment is better seen on the 3-D angiogram below.  LEFT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Reflux of contrast into the contralateral vertebral artery was achieved. The origin of PICA is normal bilaterally.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated a small medially directed outpouching just proximal to the takeoff of the left ophthalmic artery, seen on prior 3-D angiogram and stable in size, likely extradural.  COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: 1. No etiology for patient's previous perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage was identified on this angiogram. 2. There is a small medially directed outpouching of the internal carotid artery just proximal to the ophthalmic artery takeoff, previously thought to represent intracranial atherosclerotic disease, stable from prior. This lesion is also likely extradural.  Charles M Cawley, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance."}

Impression:   1.\tSuccessful placement of 18 French MIC gastrostomy tube as above.  Treatment Plan:   The tube should be placed to gravity drainage and should not be used for 24 hours. 25 cc of water can be administered per hour. At 4 hours, if residuals are less than 30%, the patient can have tube feeds advanced starting at a half dose.   Technique:   Informed consent for the procedure was obtained, and time-out was performed prior to the procedure.  The skin overlying the access site was subsequently prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the mid abdomen were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.   Using fluoroscopic and ultrasonographic guidance, an appropriate puncture site was identified.  3 T-fasteners were placed adjacent to the planned tube access site. Positioning of the T-fasteners within the gastric lumen was confirmed by return of air and direct injection of contrast material.  Next, under fluoroscopic guidance, an 18-gauge needle was directed into the gastric lumen. Needle positioning within the gastric lumen was confirmed with aspiration of air as well as gentle hand injection of contrast material.  A wire was advance through the 18-gauge needle.  The 18-gauge needle was removed over a wire. Serial dilation was accomplished over the stiff wire. An 18 French Halyard G-tube was advanced over a wire in an antegrade fashion and advanced through the anterior abdominal wall. All wires and catheters were removed. The bulb was inflated with 10 mL of a 10% contrast mixture. Gentle hand injection of contrast material documents the gastric feeding tube within the gastric lumen.

Embolic 2: 2 vials 100-300 Embospheres  Phrenic artery embolization: Additional bland embolization of the right phrenic artery to substasis with 100-300 um embospheres.  IMPRESSION:   1. MAA shunt study aborted due to unfavorable multivascular supply to the tumor.  2. Successful conventional-TACE treatment of the segment 7/8 hepatocellular carcinoma.  3. Additional bland embolization to the right phrenic artery.  TREATMENT PLAN:  1. Patient will return to clinic in 6-8 weeks with abdominal MRI and labs.  2. Access site precautions and orders placed.  TECHNIQUE:  With the patient in the supine position, the groin was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. The patient was placed on the table in a supine position. Following standard prepping and draping, the common femoral artery was punctured using a needle, and an .035 Bentson wire was advanced into the aorta. A 5-French vascular sheath was placed over the wire into the common femoral artery. A side flush was started.  A 5-Fr SOS2 catheter was advanced over an 0.035\" Bentson wire into the abdominal aorta. The catheter was used to catheterize the celiac artery. Angiograms and cone beam CT were performed and demonstrated multifocal vascular supply to the large segment 7/8 tumor, rendering the patient in unfavorable candidate. Additionally, cone beam CT showed favorable response to conventional chemotherapy performed along the superior margins of the tumor.   After conversation with the patient and his family, the decision was made to abandon MAA shunt study and pursue conventional TACE treatment. Consent was obtained from the patient's daughter, and doxorubicin was ordered from the pharmacy.  The above microwire/microcatheter system was used to catheterize distal the anterior and posterior divisions of the right hepatic artery, and chemoembolization was performed as detailed above. Follow-up contrasted and noncontrasted cone beam CTs confirmed successful treatment of the viable tumor, with minimal embolization of the normal hepatic parenchyma.  Attention was then turned to the phrenic artery, which previously demonstrated vascular supply to the superior aspects of the tumor. Phrenic artery was catheterized using a Mickelson. Repeat angiography today demonstrated vascular supply approaching the tumor, without definite tumoral blush. The decision was made to treat with bland embolization as detailed above.   A right common femoral artery angiogram was performed, demonstrating appropriate vascular access above the profunda femoris artery bifurcation. All catheters and wires were removed from the patient.

{"text": "CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM AND ENDOVASCULAR PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION OF A RIGHT SUPERIOR HYPOPHYSEAL ARTERY ANEURYSM  CLINICAL INDICATION: 49-year-old female with a past medical history of tobacco use, hypertension, dyslipidemia who presented to [HOSPITAL] in [DATE] with high grade subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to a ruptured basilar tip aneurysm for which he underwent WEB embolization. She is also noted to have unruptured right pericallosal artery aneurysm and superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm. She made a remarkable recovery following her subarachnoid hemorrhage. Given her young age, good health, and history of ruptured aneurysm, treatment of her other aneurysms was indicated. She underwent craniotomy and clip ligation of the pericallosal aneurysm [DATE] this past year. She returns today for pipeline embolization of the right superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm.  PROCEDURE:  1.\tCerebral angiogram  2.\tEndovascular pipeline embolization   DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 2 hours.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] was the fellow. [HCW], PhD was the resident. Each actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS CATHETERIZED: Right internal carotid artery Right middle cerebral artery Left vertebral artery Left internal carotid artery  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right common femoral artery Right internal carotid artery Left vertebral artery Left internal carotid artery  VESSELS TREATED (in sequence): Right internal carotid  ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. Pre-, intra-, and post-anesthesia monitoring records are available in the chart.  MEDICATIONS:  Heparin 5000 units IV Ancef 2 grams IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 8 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 0.035\" Bentson Guidewire 0.035\" Terumo Glidewire (180 cm) 6 French 65 cm arrow  5 French Merit Performa Vertebral catheter 058 Navien guide catheter (115 cm) Phenom 27 microcatheter (150 cm) Asahi 018 microguidewire (200 cm) 3.25 mm x 12 mm pipeline embolization device 6 French Angio-Seal closure device Omnipaque-300 contrast (120 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, stent thrombosis/stenosis, stent migration, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, non-target embolization, puncture site hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite, intubated, and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery. Through the dilator sheath, an angiogram of the of the right common femoral artery was obtained to ensure the arteriotomy was above the level of the bifurcation and the CFA was of sufficient size to use the 6 French Angio-Seal closure device. 6 French 65 cm arrow sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery, and under fluoroscopic guidance was advanced into the proximal descending aorta over the Bentson wire. 5000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement; additional boluses of heparin were administered at one-hour intervals. The ACT was checked to ensure that it was between 250-300.   The diagnostic catheter was used to select the right carotid artery. A roadmap angiogram right carotid artery was performed. The diagnostic catheter was advanced over the Terumo Glidewire into the right internal carotid artery. The arrow sheath was advanced over the diagnostic catheter into the right common carotid artery. Digital angiograms were performed centered over the head in the AP and lateral projections.  3D rotational angiography was performed with the selection catheter in the mid cervical segment of the right internal carotid artery to better delineate the right superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm and anatomy of the right intracranial ICA. The acquisition was processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.   The diagnostic catheter was removed from the arrow sheath and the 058 Navien guide catheter was advanced over the Terumo Glidewire into the distal cervical segment of the right internal carotid artery using roadmap angiogram fluoroscopic guidance. The Glidewire was withdrawn.   A working projection was obtained to best demonstrate the neck of the superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm, as well as, the distal and proximal landing zones for the stent. Superselective catheterization of the right middle cerebral artery was performed with the Phenom 27 microcatheter over the Asahi 18 microguidewire. The tip of the microguidewire was situated in the distal M1/proximal M2 of the right MCA. The microguidewire in the pipeline catheter was then exchanged for a 3.25 mm x 12 mm pipeline embolization device. The device was deployed under fluoroscopic guidance and a single shot X-ray was performed to confirm that the distal and proximal ends of the pipeline embolization device were in the right ICA communicating segment and right ICA cavernous segment, respectively. There was good apposition of the device along its entire course and therefore postprocessing of the pipeline embolization device was not required.  A final AP and Lateral angiogram were completed to evaluate the distal vasculature for perfusion deficits and emboli.   Using fluoroscopic guidance,  the additional arteries  listed above were selectively catheterized. Digital angiograms were performed in the AP and lateral projections centered over the head and neck.   After completion of the procedure, the sheath was removed and hemostasis obtained using the 6 French Angio-Seal closure device. A Tegaderm were then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: Diagnostic cerebral angiogram from outside institution from March of this past year.  FINDINGS: RIGHT COMMON FEMORAL ARTERY: Mild focal spasm of the proximal deep femoral artery related to access. The arteriotomy was above the level of the bifurcation and the CFA was of sufficient size to use the 6 French Angio-Seal closure device.   RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  There is a medially directed superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm, the dimensions of which are described on the 3-D angiography discussed below. Measurements of the ICA diameter were taken in very from 3.2 mm in the distal ophthalmic/proximal communicating segment to 2.8 mm in the cavernous segment. There is mild catheterization related vasospasm of the distal cervical ICA. The right middle meningeal artery originates from the distal cervical ICA.  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION): The Pipeline device is well apposed to the vessel walls throughout it's course without endoleak. . Stasis of contrast is noted within the aneurysm. . Once again there is noted to be mild to moderate catheter related spasm of the right ICA without flow limitation. No perfusion deficits to suggest distal emboli are present.  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a WEB device seen in the expected location. There is no filling of the previously seen basilar apex aneurysm. Reflux of contrast into the  contralateral vertebral artery was achieved. The origin of PICA is normal bilaterally.   LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There are aneurysm clips seen in the expected location. There is no evidence of ongoing filling from the previously treated pericallosal aneurysm. No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified.     3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY: A 3D rotational angiogram of the  right internal carotid artery was completed and post-processed on an independent work station. 3D angiography revealed a superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm which measures 3.0 x 2.8 x 2.6 x 2.3 mm (axial by axial by neck-to-dome by neck). The internal carotid artery from the distal ophthalmic segment to the mid cavernous segment measures from 3.1 to 3.4 mm in diameter.    COMPLICATIONS: none immediate.  IMPRESSION:  1.\tSuccessful placement of pipeline embolization device in the right ICA for treatment of unruptured superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm. 2.\tMild iatrogenic catheter related vasospasm of the right ICA stenosis 3.\tNo evidence of residual or recurrent basilar apex aneurysm or left pericallosal aneurysm. 4.\tIndependent origin of the right subclavian artery, remote from the origin of the right common carotid artery. Common origin of the right and left common carotid arteries, which did not require reverse curve catheter for catheterization."}

After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. We attempted to gain access to the right common femoral artery using ultrasound but were unable to despite several attempts. We did cannulate the common femoral vein using the microcatheter dilator, then removed the microcatheter dilator and held manual pressure for 10 minutes until adequate hemostasis was achieved. We then discussed with the patient different options done to proceed. Given the result of the aneurysm coiling during her treatment angiogram, we recommended that the patient first obtained an MRA time-of-flight time resolved. If that MRA were to show concern for recurrence, we could bring the patient back on a different date and attempt a transradial approach. The patient was agreeable to this plan and we aborted the procedure.  COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: 1. Aborted diagnostic cerebral angiogram due to difficulty obtaining access into the right common femoral artery which was limited by body habitus. Plan to obtain MRA time-of-flight time resolved in the meantime and consider a radial approach in the future.  Charles M Cawley, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance."}

{"text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Male Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL]  ESRC.[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  Acute cholecystitis with cholecystostomy drain. No output from the drain.  Procedure:   1.\tFluoroscopic guided cholecystogram and cholecystostomy drain replacement  Findings:   1.\t Collapsed gallbladder body with filling of the proximal cystic duct there is no passage into the central cystic duct and into the common bile duct consistent with cystic duct occlusion. Perihepatic ascites.  Impression:   1.\t Technically successful image guided cholecystogram and replacement of cholecystostomy drain  Treatment Plan:   1. Drain to gravity drainage bag. Given collapsed gallbladder cavity, drainage may be minimal. Given perihepatic ascites, there may be leaking from around the drain skin site.  Technique:    The patient was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. The skin and underlying soft tissue was an exercise with 1% lidocaine. Contrast was injected through the existing cholecystostomy drain for a cholecystogram. An Amplatz wire was advanced through the existing drain and looped within the caudal gallbladder body. Upon removal of the existing drain over the guidewire, there was retraction of the tip of the Amplatz wire. An angled catheter was advanced over the wire, however the wire could not be removed through the catheter. The catheter and guidewire were removed together.   Using an angled catheter and Glidewire, the hepatic tract was catheterized and catheter advanced over the guidewire into the gallbladder body. Contrast was injected to confirm a stable position. Different guidewires (Amplatz) were used, however could not be adequately looped within the gallbladder body to advance a multipurpose drainage catheter. A Rosen guidewire was advanced into the gallbladder body, over which, an 8 French anchor drain (Malecot) was advanced. The anchor drain was locked within the gallbladder body and connected to gravity drainage bag and sutured to the skin with 2-0 Prolene suture. Contrast injection demonstrated appropriate positioning.   The patient tolerated the procedure without immediate consultation.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 30 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 13.9 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  175.58 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department.
