Right antegrade nephrostogram and percutaneous nephroureterostomy exchange.   Findings:  1. Right antegrade nephrostogram demonstrates decompressed renal pelvis with PCN U tube in correct positioning 2. Newly placed 10.2 French X 24 cm PCN-U is appropriately positioned with the proximal loop in the renal pelvis and distal loop in the urinary bladder.  Impression:  Uneventful image-guided exchange of Right 10.2 French 24 cm percutaneous nephroureterostomy tube.   Plan:   Patient will be due for routine exchange in roughly 3 months.   Technique:  With the patient in prone position, the right flank were prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. A scout radiograph was obtained.   Contrast was injected through the existing nephrostomy/nephroureterostomy tube and imaging of the collecting was system performed. A 0.035\" Glidewire advantage wire was placed through the tube and the tube removed over the wire and discarded. A new, 8-French x 22 cm nephroureterostomy tube was advanced over the wire under fluoroscopic guidance. The wire was removed and the proximal loop formed and locked in the renal pelvis. Contrast injection confirmed location.  The catheter was sutured to the flank and placed to gravity drainage. A sterile dressing was applied.    The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition without any immediate postprocedural complications.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s):     Resident(s): [HCW] Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 20 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 1.6 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  1.66 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 40 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.   Antibiotics: Rocephin, 2 g IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Janice Newsome, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

An ultrasound image documenting vein patency was stored to PACS. 2.\tThe port catheter has a smooth course with the tip terminating in the right atrium 3.\tThe small bore central line was removed in its entirety en bloc  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful placement of a tunneled right internal jugular 8 French single lumen Bard power Port-A-Cath using sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance. 2.\tSuccessful removal of small bore central line en bloc  Treatment Plan:   The catheter tip is in good position. The line flushes and aspirates appropriately.  The catheter is okay to use.  Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed above.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Subsequently, the right chest was anesthetized with lidocaine solution , both with and without epinephrine. An incision was made. A port pocket was created. The port reservoir was placed within the port pocket after adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The port was not affixed to the chest wall with suture.  The catheter was tunneled under the skin of the right  chest.   Under fluoroscopic guidance, a peel-away sheath was advanced through the venotomy site over a guide wire to the level of the right atrium. The catheter was inserted through the peel-away sheath and into the  internal jugular vein  via a peel-away sheath after removal of the dilator and wire. Static fluoroscopic image was obtained documenting the tip of the port catheter in good position near the cavoatrial junction. The port flushes and aspirates appropriately.   The port pocket was closed with buried, interrupted subcutaneous 3-0 and continuous 4-0 subcuticular absorbable sutures.  Dermabond was used to close the skin.  The access site was sealed with  Dermabond.   The sutures around the small bore central line were cut and the catheter removed. Hemostasis was achieved using manual pressure in the neck.   The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate post procedural complication.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Judy W. Gichoya Fellow(s): None  Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 1.4 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  2.62 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 60 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1.5 mg IV. Fentanyl 75 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

    "text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Male Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL].[ID].[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  This is a 76-year-old man with multiple medical problems, including vascular dementia, stroke with right hemiparesis, hypertension, prostate cancer, and aspiration with acute respiratory failure with worsening metabolic encephalopathy who was admitted to the hospital on [DATE] and transferred to the ICU on [DATE] with a GI bleed/hematochezia and hypotension. CT angiogram showed a bleed in the rectum. Thrombocytopenia (18,000 platelets) precluded colonoscopy and he was taken to the IR suite for embolization under anesthesia.  Procedures: Ultrasound and fluoroscopy-guided  peritoneal catheter placement Ultrasound and fluoroscopy-guided pericardial drain placement  Findings: The CT angiogram from 10:40 AM was reviewed  1. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. The left hemidiaphragm is elevated. There is contrast in the left colon. Monitor leads are in place. A CO2 monitor is in the distal esophagus. 2. Ultrasound confirms pericardial fluid. It appears to be of similar amount to that seen on the CT from several hours earlier. 3. The initial 8 French catheter placed aspirated frank blood. Contrast injection confirmed this to be in the peritoneal cavity. Several 100 mL bloody fluid were aspirated and a sample was sent to the lab. 4. Contrast injection of the second catheter confirms pericardial location. 5. Pericardial fluid returned clear yellow. 6. An 8 French pigtail catheter is adequately positioned and the pericardium. A total of 80 mL clear fluid were aspirated.  Impression:   Critically ill patient who experienced cardiac arrest prior to the visceral arteriography initiation.  An 8 French peritoneal catheter was placed, aspirating bloody fluid.  An 8 French pericardial drain aspirated 80 mL clear yellow fluid.    Technique:  The patient was brought to the IR suite in critical condition.  A left radial art line was in place. Since a radial approach was warranted due to severe thrombocytopenia, the left radial art line was exchanged for a 5 French slender technology sheath. Attention was redirected to placement of an material line on the right for monitoring.  Prior to procedure initiation, the patient experienced cardiac arrest. ROSC was achieved. The patient was responding poorly to resuscitative efforts. Due to the presence of ultrasonographic pericardial fluid and poor left ventricular volume, the decision was made to place a pericardial drain.  The anterior chest wall was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. A 21-gauge needle was advanced toward the pericardial fluid under direct ultrasound guidance. Initially, the wire coursed caudal. The catheter was placed and found to be in the peritoneal cavity. Several 100 mL grossly bloody fluid were aspirated.  From a different window, a longer 21-gauge needle was used to access the pericardial space. Ultrasound images confirmed location. Fluid returned was clear yellow. A 0.018 inch wire was placed. The needle was exchanged for a transitional dilator. The smaller wire was replaced with a short Amplatz wire. Contrast injection confirmed pericardial location. The transitional dilator was exchanged for an 8 French pigtail catheter.  The retention loop of this catheter was formed in the pericardium. 80 mL clear yellow fluid were removed.  The patient was found to be in refractory shock and in spite of blood product administration, pericardial drain placement, and massive pressor support, he could not be successfully resuscitated. The procedure was aborted.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Gail Peters Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 20 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 2.4 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  45 mGy  Conscious Sedation: The procedure was performed with anesthesiology present with the patient intubated.  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Procedure:   1.\tExchange of 18 French gastrostomy tube for a low profile gastrojejunostomy tube.       Findings:   Scout image demonstrates a gastrostomy tube with balloon projecting within the plane of the left upper quadrant. There is diffuse gaseous distention.  1.\tThe existing tube is confirmed to be within the gastric lumen.   2.\tThe new low profile tube is appropriately positioned with the distal aspect of the tube terminating in jejunal loops within the plane of the right upper quadrant. Findings are suggestive of small bowel malrotation.  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful exchange for an 18 French 3.5 cm low profile gastrojejunostomy tube with tip in jejunum.  2.\tJejunal loops are noted to be in the plane of the right upper quadrant indicative of small bowel malrotation.  Treatment Plan:    It is OK to use the tube immediately.      Routine check and change recommended in 6 months.  Technique:   Informed consent for the procedure was obtained, and time-out was performed prior to the procedure.  The skin overlying the access site was subsequently prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).    A scout image was obtained over the abdomen with findings detailed above.  Contrast was injected through the existing gastrostomy tube to confirm position as detailed above. Next, a stiff Glidewire was cannulated through the gastrostomy tube and seen coiling within the gastric lumen. The balloon was deflated gastrostomy tube was removed over the wire however during the exchange wire access was lost. Next, a 5 French Kumpe catheter and stiff Glidewire were used to navigate under fluoroscopic guidance through the subcutaneous tract and into the gastric lumen which was confirmed with contrast injection.  The Kumpe catheter and stiff Glidewire were used to navigate through the pylorus and opacify jejunal loops noted to be within the right upper quadrant. A stoma measuring device was used to measure the stoma length and was noted to be an approximately 3.5 cm. A  22 French peel-away sheath was advanced into the gastric lumen. Through this a new 18 French by 3.5 cm gastrojejunostomy tube was advanced over the wire through the peel-away sheath. Its tip was placed in the proximal jejunum. The bulb was inflated with approximately 10 mL of 10% contrast mixture. The wire was removed and contrast injection confirmed appropriate positioning of the gastric and jejunal side ports. The disc was cinched.        Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Steven Citron Fellow(s): Dr. Rameez Rehman Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 70 mL      Fluoroscopy time: 4.4 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  8.3 mGy  Conscious Sedation: Sedation was provided via general anesthesia. For further details please refer to the anesthesia record.  Medications: For further details please refer to the anesthesia record.  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Steven Citron, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

An ultrasound image documenting vein patency was stored to PACS. 2.\tThe port catheter has a smooth course with the tip terminating in the right atrium 3.\tThe small bore central line was removed in its entirety en bloc  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful placement of a tunneled right internal jugular 8 French single lumen Bard power Port-A-Cath using sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance. 2.\tSuccessful removal of small bore central line en bloc  Treatment Plan:   The catheter tip is in good position. The line flushes and aspirates appropriately.  The catheter is okay to use.  Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed above.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Subsequently, the right chest was anesthetized with lidocaine solution , both with and without epinephrine. An incision was made. A port pocket was created. The port reservoir was placed within the port pocket after adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The port was not affixed to the chest wall with suture.  The catheter was tunneled under the skin of the right  chest.   Under fluoroscopic guidance, a peel-away sheath was advanced through the venotomy site over a guide wire to the level of the right atrium. The catheter was inserted through the peel-away sheath and into the  internal jugular vein  via a peel-away sheath after removal of the dilator and wire. Static fluoroscopic image was obtained documenting the tip of the port catheter in good position near the cavoatrial junction. The port flushes and aspirates appropriately.   The port pocket was closed with buried, interrupted subcutaneous 3-0 and continuous 4-0 subcuticular absorbable sutures.  Dermabond was used to close the skin.  The access site was sealed with  Dermabond.   The sutures around the small bore central line were cut and the catheter removed. Hemostasis was achieved using manual pressure in the neck.

    "text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Male Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL]C.[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  Pancreatic mass with biliary obstruction.   Sequence of events so far:  1. [DATE]      Common bile duct access lost during endoscopic stent exchange   2. [DATE]      PTC with 12 French right internal/external biliary drain placement under GA 3. [DATE]      Biliary drain malpositioned with peritoneal loop. The catheter 12 French was exchanged with moderate sedation 4. [DATE]      A covered stent was placed in the common hepatic and common bile duct under sedation, requiring a large amount of narcotic with poor pain control 5. [DATE]      Today the patient returns for cholangiography for possible drain removal under general anesthesia   PROCEDURE: Catheter cholangiogram and internal/external drain replacement     FINDINGS: Comparison is made to a prior study dated [DATE]. Images from [DATE] and [DATE] were also reviewed..  1.  The scout radiograph shows the internal/external biliary drain appearing appropriately positioned. There is no leakage at the flank. 2 covered stents are visualized in the extrahepatic bile ducts. 2.  Sheath cholangiogram shows narrowing of the common hepatic duct above the central extent of the stent. The bile ducts are decompressed. 3.  There is extrinsic compression by mass from the left toward the right, narrowing the cephalad portion of the common hepatic duct just beyond the biliary confluence. This is seen as a filling defect with injection at the confluence. 4. The hepatic parenchymal tract is mature. 5. There is ongoing fistulous communication of the mass with the duodenum. 6. The newly placed 12 French right internal/external biliary drain is appropriately positioned. The cope loop was removed to prevent suture entanglement with the stents should further exchanges be required.   IMPRESSION:  1.  Interval progression of tumor with extrinsic compression of the common hepatic duct near the biliary confluence. 2.  Uneventful image guided replacement of an internal/external biliary catheter as described. 3. This patient will be catheter dependent from this point forward.   PLAN: 1.  Routine maintenance in 12 weeks. 2.  The patient was asked to go to the emergency room for lower extremity swelling. He declined and states he would rather go to the emergency room near his home in [HOSPITAL].   TECHNIQUE:    The existing catheter and surrounding soft tissues were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.    A 0.035\" glidewire was negotiated through the catheter into the small bowel.  The catheter was removed over the wire and a short 8 French sheath placed. Sheath injection evaluated the biliary tree. Proximal tumor extension was identified with extrinsic compression just beyond the hilum.  A DSA run showed a patent stent with some irregularity and prompt flow into the duodenum. A 5F catheter was placed adjacent to the glide to better delineate the cephalad portion of the common hepatic duct.  A tractogram was performed on sheath withdrawal.  A 12 French internal/external biliary drain with extended sideholes (no standard catheter available) was modified by removing the retention suture and placed over the wire.  Contrast was injected to confirm tube position.  The tube was capped.  The catheter was secured to the skin with 2-0 Ethilon.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications and was discharged still asleep into the care of anesthesiology for transfer to the PACU.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Gail Peters Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 40 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 4.3 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  150 mGy  Conscious Sedation: The procedure was performed under general anesthesia with intubation   Antibiotics: 2 g IV Rocephin  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Real-time US images through the right chest wall demonstrate appropriate percutaneous drainage. 2. Real-time US images through the left lower quadrant demonstrate appropriate fluid pocket for aspiration  Impression:   Technically successful US-guided drainage of right breast/chest wall fluid collection, aspiration of left lower quadrant flap donor site.  Treatment Plan:   1. Flush drain with 20 cc saline q8h as inpatient and 20 cc saline q24h as outpatient. 2. When drainage falls to below 10 cc/day (excluding flushes) for three consecutive days, please obtain repeat cross-sectional imaging and/or contact IR for possible removal.  Technique:  Target: right chest wall  Imaging: US Drain: 8 Fr APD/Mermaid Drainage: 70 mL serosanguinous fluid aspirated during procedure Microbiology: Sample sent  Target: left lower quadrant Imaging: US Drain: 5F catheter used to aspirate, then removed Drainage: 40 mL serous fluid aspirated during procedure Microbiology: Sample sent  A superficial skin entry site was selected based on available imaging and the overlying skin entry site was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier to target the above collection. The skin surface was anesthetized with 1-2% lidocaine. Using continuous real-time grayscale and/or color doppler ultrasound guidance, a needle was introduced into the target site and imaging guidance confirmed adequate positioning. The access device was utilized with an 0.035\" wire to introduce the drainage catheter listed above following any necessary serial dilatation. Ultrasound images confirmed appropriate positioning within the target structure. The catheter was secured to the skin surface using nonabsorbable suture material and dressed in typical fashion. Any samples not sent to laboratory for analysis were discarded. The patient tolerated the procedure and was sent to the recovery area for monitoring.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s): [HCW] Resident(s):     Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  0 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 30 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Anesthesia  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

This patient had a prior Pleurx catheter which was removed for infection on [DATE]. She is requiring paracentesis every few days.   Procedure: PleurX tunneled peritoneal drainage catheter placement with ultrasound and fluoro with large volume paracentesis         Findings:  Removal images from [DATE] and abdominal CT scan from [DATE] were reviewed  1. There is moderate chylous ascites. 2. The peritoneal catheter is positioned appropriately, coursing from the right into the left lower quadrant. 3. Total volume removed was 3.75 L.   Impression:  Recurrent chylous ascites.  Uneventful image guided placement of 15 French multi sidehole PleurX intraperitoneal  catheter to facilitate frequent large volume paracentesis.  3.75 liters clear yellow fluid were removed without incident.   Technique:    The anterior abdominal wall was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Ultrasonographic evaluation was carried out, and an appropriate entry site identified in the right mid abdomen. Using local anesthetic and ultrasound guidance, the peritoneal space was accessed with an 18-gauge sheathed needle. Hilar fluid was returned. Needle entry was documented, and images transferred to PACS.  An Amplatz wire was placed through the catheter and directed toward the left paracolic gutter. The skin tract was dilated and a large peel-away sheath placed.    The soft tissues cephalad and medial to the sheath entry site were anesthetized with 2% lidocaine with epinephrine. A dermatotomy was created, and the PleurX catheter was pulled through the tunnel with the tunneling device. The cuff was positioned in the midportion of the 8 cm tunnel.  The intraperitoneal wire and dilator were removed, and the catheter was placed through the peel-away. It was positioned using fluoroscopy. The peel-away was removed.  The peritoneal puncture site was closed with a deep 3-0 absorbable suture and Dermabond.   2-0 Ethilon suture was placed at the tunnel exit site to secure the catheter.  A sterile dressing was applied.  Subsequently, large volume paracentesis was performed through the newly placed catheter. A total of 3.75 liters clear yellow fluid were removed.  The procedure was well tolerated, and the patient was discharged in satisfactory condition.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Gail Peters Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.8 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  6 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 60 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. 1 mg IV Dilaudid.  Antibiotics: 2 g IV Ancef  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

An ultrasound image documenting vein patency was stored to PACS. 2.\tThe port catheter has a smooth course with the tip terminating near the cavoatrial junction.  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful placement of a tunneled right internal jugular 8 French single lumen Bard power Port-A-Cath using sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance.  Treatment Plan:   The catheter tip is in good position. The line flushes and aspirates appropriately.  The catheter is okay to use.  Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed below.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Subsequently, the right chest was anesthetized with lidocaine solution with epinephrine. An incision was made. A port pocket was created. The port reservoir was placed within the port pocket after adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The port was not affixed to the chest wall with suture.  The catheter was tunneled under the skin of the right  chest.   Under fluoroscopic guidance, a peel-away sheath was advanced through the venotomy site over a guide wire to the level of the right atrium. The catheter was inserted through the peel-away sheath and into the  internal jugular vein  via a peel-away sheath after removal of the dilator and wire. Static fluoroscopic image was obtained documenting the tip of the port catheter in good position near the cavoatrial junction. The port flushes and aspirates appropriately.   The port pocket was closed with buried, interrupted subcutaneous 3-0 absorbable sutures and Dermabond was used to close the skin.  The access site was sealed with  Dermabond.   The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate post procedural complication.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): None Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): Sandy Pang PA-C, Hee Kang PA-C  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 259 seconds Fluoroscopy dose:  28.65 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 71 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.  Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I Sandy Pang, PA-C, performed the above procedure, Dr. Hearns Charles was the attending of the day. Hee Kang PA-C was in attendance and assisted in the case.  Hee Kang, PA, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

Patient had previous nephroureterostomy tubes but was unable to tolerate them due to bladder pain.  Procedure:   1.\tBilateral nephrostogram(s) and nephrostomy tube replacement  Comparison: Previous exam [DATE]  Findings:    1.\tExisting nephrostomy tube(s) in appropriate position on scout radiograph. 2.\tNephrostography demonstrates no hydronephrosis without drainage into the urinary bladder.   Catheter:  10.2 F Cook nephrostomy tube(s) bilateral  Impression:   1.\tUneventful image-guided bilateral nephrostomy tube re-placement.  Treatment Plan:   Patient should return for routine check and change in 8-12 weeks.  Technique:   The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure and sedation were explained to the patient. Written informed consent was obtained. A time out/call to order was performed prior to procedure initiation.  Right nephrostomy tube  The existing catheter(s) and surrounding soft tissues were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines). Local anesthetic was injected at the catheter entry site. A scout radiograph was obtained.  Non-ionic contrast was injected through the existing nephrostomy tube(s) and images of the collecting system obtained and stored to PACS.  An 0.035” wire was advanced through the nephrostomy tube. The tube was removed over the wire under direct fluoroscopic visualization. A new nephrostomy tube was advanced over the wire and the Cope loop formed and locked in the renal pelvis. Contrast injection confirmed appropriate location. The catheter was sutured to the flank with monofilament suture and attached to gravity drainage. A sterile dressing was applied.  Left nephrostomy tube  The existing catheter(s) and surrounding soft tissues were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).

Contrast injection confirmed appropriate location. The catheter was sutured to the flank with monofilament suture and attached to gravity drainage. A sterile dressing was applied.  The procedure was well tolerated, and patient discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Judy W. Gichoya Fellow(s): None Resident(s): Dr. DeAngelo Harris Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 15 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 2.8 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  9.09 mGy  Conscious Sedation: Performed with MAC anesthesia due to inability to tolerate pain in the prior PCNU to PCN conversion.   Medications: See anesthesia notes  Antibiotics: Rocephin, 2 g IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

    "text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Female Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL].IR.1  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  History of Morel Lavallee lesion within the right knee status post drain placement with persistent drain output from one drain and decreased output from additional drains with peridrain leakage. CT right knee [DATE] identifies 3 persistent collections and 1 undrained collection.  Procedure:   Ultrasound and fluoroscopic guided drainage of Right knee fluid collection (1) Fluoroscopic guided drain evaluation and exchange of right knee fluid collections (3)  Findings:   1. Real-time ultrasound and intermittent fluoroscopic images through the right knee demonstrate appropriate percutaneous drainage. 2. Intermittent fluoroscopic images through the right knee demonstrate small residual collections.  Impression:   Technically successful ultrasound and fluoroscopic drain placement into 1 right knee fluid collection, and a drain upsize into the persistent 3 right knee fluid collections.  Treatment Plan:   1.\tFlush drain with 20 cc saline q24h as outpatient. 2.\tFollow-up with plastic surgeon at scheduled appointment at end [DATE]. Determine if Incision & Drainage is planned. If not, discuss IR's intent to perform sclerotherapy as the collections will have been present for ~5 months and she has completed 3 drain placement/evaluations already without resolution. 3.\tReturn to IR in 6-8 weeks for percutaneous drain evaluation and Doxycycline sclerotherapy. Or, when drainage falls to below 10 cc/day (excluding flushes) for three consecutive days, please obtain repeat cross-sectional imaging and/or contact IR for possible removal.  Technique:  Target: Right knee abscesses  Imaging: US & Fluoroscopy Drain: 10 Fr APD x 3, 12 Fr APD x 1 Drainage: 20 mL serosanguinous fluid aspirated during procedure Microbiology: N/A  A superficial skin entry site was selected based on available imaging and the overlying skin entry site was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier to target the above collection.  Upper-lateral right knee collection: The skin surface was anesthetized with 1-2% lidocaine. Using realtime US imaging guidance, a needle was introduced into the target site, with imaging guidance confirming adequate positioning. The access device was utilized with an 0.035\" wire to introduce the drainage catheter listed above following any necessary serial dilatation. Fluoroscopic images confirmed appropriate positioning within the target structure. The catheter was secured to the skin surface using nonabsorbable suture material and dressed in typical fashion. Any samples not sent to laboratory for analysis were discarded.   Lower-lateral right knee collection: The skin surface was anesthetized with 1-2% lidocaine. Using intermittent fluoroscopic imaging, the existing drain was injected with contrast to confirm appropriate position and estimate the size of residual collection. The suture was cut, drain retention mechanism release, and a wire advanced into the collection. Over the wire, existing 8 Fr APD was exchanged for a 10 Fr APD. Wire was removed and contrast and fluid contents aspirated. The catheter was secured to the skin surface using nonabsorbable suture material and dressed in typical fashion. Any samples not sent to laboratory for analysis were discarded.  Lower-medial right knee collection: The skin surface was anesthetized with 1-2% lidocaine. Using intermittent fluoroscopic imaging, the existing drain was injected with contrast to confirm appropriate position and estimate the size of residual collection. The suture was cut, drain retention mechanism release, and a wire advanced into the collection. Over the wire, existing 8 Fr APD was exchanged for a 10 Fr APD. Wire was removed and contrast and fluid contents aspirated. The catheter was secured to the skin surface using nonabsorbable suture material and dressed in typical fashion. Any samples not sent to laboratory for analysis were discarded.  Upper-medial right knee collection: The skin surface was anesthetized with 1-2% lidocaine. Using intermittent fluoroscopic imaging, the existing drain was injected with contrast to confirm appropriate position and estimate the size of residual collection. The suture was cut, drain retention mechanism release, and a wire advanced into the collection. Over the wire, existing 10 Fr APD was exchanged for a 12 Fr APD. Wire was removed and contrast and fluid contents aspirated. The catheter was secured to the skin surface using nonabsorbable suture material and dressed in typical fashion. Any samples not sent to laboratory for analysis were discarded.  The patient tolerated the procedure and was sent to the recovery area for monitoring.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Ahmed Al-Khafaji Fellow(s):     Resident(s):     Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 20 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 6.2 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  29.04 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 62 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 3 mg IV. Fentanyl 200 mcg IV. Lidocaine 10 mL subcutaneously.  Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a 14 French,  13 cm, non-tunneled large bore central venous catheter via the right internal jugular vein.  Treatment Plan:   Routine catheter care. The catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed below.   The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic. Ultrasound evaluation of the vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS. Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS.  A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, a 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance. This image was not saved.  The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of the catheter over the wire. The catheter was subsequently introduced over the wire and the wire removed. The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): None Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): [HCW] PA-C  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.7 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  9 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 10 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 0.5 mg IV.  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I, Hilary Karp PA C. performed the procedure. Dr. Al-Khafaji was the attending of record.",

Procedure:   Transjugular liver biopsy with pressure measurements  Findings:   1.\tThe right hepatic vein is normal in caliber and appearance. 2.\tThe biopsy specimen appeared adequate. 3.\tThe right internal jugular vein is ultrasonographically patent and compresses. Needle entry was documented. 4.\tPressures:  a. Wedged hepatic pressure: 16 mm Hg b. Free hepatic pressure: 14 mm Hg c. Corrected Sinusoidal Pressure: 2 mm Hg  d. Right atrial: 7 mm Hg e. Infra-hepatic IVC: 18 mm Hg f. Post-anastomotic IVC: 18 mm Hg     Impression:   Successful image guided transjugular liver biopsy. Corrected sinusoidal pressure of 2 mm Hg.    Treatment Plan:  Follow up pathology results.  Technique:   The procedure, options, and risks were reviewed with patient, including bleeding, infection, and pneumothorax. A time out was performed before initiating the procedure.  The skin overlying the access site was subsequently prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines). Patient sedation was performed, as detailed below.  The right neck was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Using local anesthetic and ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was punctured with a 21 gauge needle with permanent reporting and recording. An image documenting vein patency and needle entry was stored and transferred to PACS. A 9 French sheath was placed at the neck.  An angled catheter was used to select the right hepatic vein and hepatic venography performed using nonionic contrast. Free and wedged hepatic pressures were obtained using the diagnostic catheter.  A 0.035” wire was placed in the hepatic vein and the 7 French Cook biopsy cannula was advanced over the wire. The wire was removed, and 3 passes made with the 18 gauge coaxial needle.  The specimen was placed in formalin and delivered to the laboratory.  The cannula and sheath were removed and hemostasis achieved with manual compression. No immediate complication occurred, and the patient was discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Brandon Lei Fellow(s): Dr. Kwaku Opoku Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 20 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 11.6 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  68 mGy  Conscious Sedation: Please see separate anesthesia record for details pertaining to the patient's sedation and monitoring.  Medications: None.  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

An ultrasound image documenting vein patency was stored to PACS. 2.\tThe port catheter has a smooth course with the tip terminating near the cavoatrial junction.  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful placement of a tunneled right internal jugular 8 French single lumen Bard power Port-A-Cath using sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance.  Treatment Plan:   The catheter tip is in good position. The line flushes and aspirates appropriately.  The catheter is okay to use.  Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed below  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Subsequently, the right chest was anesthetized with lidocaine solution , both with and without epinephrine. An incision was made. A port pocket was created. The port reservoir was placed within the port pocket after adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The port was not affixed to the chest wall with suture.  The catheter was tunneled under the skin of the right  chest.   Under fluoroscopic guidance, a peel-away sheath was advanced through the venotomy site over a guide wire to the level of the right atrium. The catheter was inserted through the peel-away sheath and into the  internal jugular vein  via a peel-away sheath after removal of the dilator and wire. Static fluoroscopic image was obtained documenting the tip of the port catheter in good position near the cavoatrial junction. The port flushes and aspirates appropriately.   The port pocket was closed with buried, interrupted subcutaneous 2-0 absorbable sutures. Dermabond was used to close the skin.  The access site was sealed with Dermabond.   The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate post procedural complication.   Procedural Personnel Advanced practice provider(s): Lindsay Greco, NP  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.7 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  7.91 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 30 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: Ancef 2g   Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.    I Lindsay Greco, ACNP, performed the above procedure, Dr. David Prologo was the attending of the day.",

Vein patency was documented by ultrasound and stored to PACS. 2.  The catheter tip terminates near the cavoatrial junction.        Impression:   1.\tUneventful image guided placement of 5 French, 44 cm single-lumen PICC in the right upper extremity as described. The lumens flush and aspirate appropriately.        Treatment Plan:   Catheter tip position is confirmed as above. It is OK to use this line.       Technique:   The site was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).   Ultrasound evaluation of the right basilic vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS. Local anesthetic was used over the access site. Under ultrasound guidance, the right basilic vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS.    A 0.018\" wire was passed centrally and the needle exchanged for a dilator peel-away combination. The wire was used to determine catheter length, and a 5 French single-lumen PICC line cut to appropriate length. The tailored catheter was advanced through the peel-away and positioned centrally using fluoroscopy.   The peel-away was removed, and hemostasis achieved with manual compression. The catheter was aspirated, flushed, and locked per protocol. It was secured in place with Ethilon.  An antimicrobial disc and sterile dressing were applied.  The procedure was well tolerated, and the patient discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.   Attention was then changed to port removal left chest Procedure:   1.\tPort removal under fluoroscopic guidance  Findings:   1.\tThe port catheter has a smooth course with the tip terminating near the cavoatrial junction. 2.\tSuccessful removal of port catheter en bloc  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful removal of port catheter en bloc  Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed below.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the left chest were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic. An incision was made. The port pocket was accessed using sharp and blunt dissection. The port catheter was removed en bloc.    The port pocket was closed with buried, interrupted subcutaneous 3-0 absorbable sutures. Dermabond was used to close the skin.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate post procedural complication.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): None Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): Hilary Karp, PA-C  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 1.3 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  5.56 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Administered by anesthesia and Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 30 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Refer to anesthesia notes  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I, Hilary Karp PA C. performed the procedure. Dr. Al-Khafaji was the attending of record.",

Fluoroscopic guided exchange of tunneled small bore central line to a large bore central line (Line removal and new line placed - via exchange over wire)  Findings:  1. Scout image demonstrates existing right internal jugular vein tunneled small bore central line with tip positioned in the right atrium. 2. Newly exchanged right internal jugular tunneled large bore central line (trifusion) is appropriately positioned with the tip in the right atrium.   Impression:  Uneventful image guided wire exchange of a right internal jugular vein tunneled small bore central line to a right internal jugular tunneled large bore central line (trifusion)   Plan:  Catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:  The right chest wall and area immediately around the existing tunneled catheter was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier.  Using local anesthetic, the tract was anesthetized. Suture securing line cut and removed. A V18 wire was passed down existing small bore tunneled line and down the inferior vena cava. Imaging stored onto PACS. The catheter was then pulled with gentle traction until it was completely removed over the wire. The smaller dilator in the line trifusion kit was passed over the V18 wire. A amplatz wire was then passed through the dilator after the V18 was removed and passed down the inferior vena cava. The small dilator was removed over the wire and the larger peel-away sheath was then passed over the wire into position. A new triple lumen trifusion catheter was advanced over the wire until the tip was positioned appropriately and the cuff positioned within the tunnel.   Nonabsorbable suture was placed at the catheter tunnel exit site. An antimicrobial disc and sterile dressing were applied.  The catheter was aspirated, flushed, and heparinized per protocol. The procedure was well tolerated, and the patient was discharged in satisfactory condition.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Advanced practice provider(s): [HCW]  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 1.8 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  10.92 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 45 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.   Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I Kelda Kemp, NP, performed the above procedure, Dr. Meghan Lilly was the attending of the day.",

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a  15.5 French, 19 cm (tip-to-cuff), tunneled large bore central venous catheter via the right internal jugular vein.  Treatment Plan:   1. Routine catheter care. 2. The catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed above.  The skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle. An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the dialysis catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of a peel-away sheath.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. J. David Prologo Advanced practice provider(s): Ian McMillan, PA-C  Complications: No immediate complications.  Fluoroscopy time: 0.4 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  2.33 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 30 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 0 mg IV. Fentanyl 100 mcg IV.   Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I Ian McMillan, PA, performed the above procedure under supervision of, Dr. Prologo was the attending of the day.",

    "text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Male Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL].[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  End-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis access. Known central venous stenoses.  Procedure:   1.\tBilateral upper extremity to central venography 2.\tInferior vena cavagram 3.\tUS evaluation of the right internal jugular vein 4.\tConversion of left femoral vein vascath to permcath  Findings:   1.\tOcclusion of the bilateral brachiocephalic veins with sluggish flow towards the heart via collaterals. 2.\tPatent IVC with large filling defects in the infrarenal IVC and bilateral common iliac veins corresponding to non-occlusive thrombosis demonstrated on recent cross-sectional imaging.  3.\tDistal right IJ thrombus as also seen on recent cross-sectional imaging. 4.  Successful conversion of preexisting left groin vascath to 55cm permcath, terminating near the inferior cavoatrial junction.  Catheter is ready to use.  Impression:   1. Right internal jugular and iliocaval acute thromboses. 2. Bilateral brachiocephalic venous occlusion, with extensive collaterals. 3. Successful placement of left common femoral venous tunneled hemodialysis catheter.  Treatment Plan:   1. Routine catheter care. 2. The catheter is ready for immediate use. 3. Therapeutic anticoagulation recommended.  Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed above.  Bilateral upper extremity central venography was performed by contrast injection into previously placed peripheral intravenous catheters under fluoroscopy with findings as detailed above. The right internal jugular vein was evaluated with ultrasound and permanent images stored to PACS.  The skin and subcutaneous tissues surrounding the indwelling left common femoral venous nontunneled catheter were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic. Contrast was injected into this catheter and images were stored. After local anesthetic was injected, a new 55 cm PermCath was tunneled through the skin of the thigh towards the venotomy site. A 0.035 inch stiff Amplatz wire was advanced through the indwelling catheter, and the indwelling catheter was removed over the wire. A peel-away sheath was advanced over the wire. The new catheter was advanced through the peel-away sheath into the inferior vena cava.  The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.  The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Brandon Lei Fellow(s): Dr. Ross Bittman Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 50 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 2.2 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  14 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 33 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. 150 mcg IV.  Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  50-100 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Brandon Lei, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 20 minutes.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] was the fellow. Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Left Internal Carotid Artery  ANESTHESIA: Local in the right groin with bupivacaine. Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by the nurse present during the entire procedure. The patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Sedation was administered by a specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for the duration of the procedure as outlined above (Total intra service time, 20 ). Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Versed 1 mg IV Fentanyl 50 mcg IV Heparin 3000 units IV Protamine 20 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter  Cardiva Vascade Visipaque-270 contrast material (40 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the left internal carotid artery for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Vascade followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Prior angiogram.  FINDINGS:  LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: The previously coil embolized anterior communicating artery embolism demonstrate minimal residual filling at the base measuring 2 mm x 0.6 mm. The bilateral ACAs fill from the left A1 segment. Flash filling of the right A1 and M1 segments is noted with a patent right A1 segment.  The ICA and its segments are normal course and caliber. The MCA and its branches are normal course and caliber. There is normal cortical venous drainage. No other aneurysms are identified.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated minimal residual filling at the base of the previously coil embolized anterior communicating artery aneurysm measuring 2 mm x 0.6mm.   COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: There is minimal residual filling of the previously coil embolized anterior communicating artery aneurysm measuring 2 mm x 0.6mm. This aneurysm fills predominantly from the left A1 segment of the ACA. The bilateral ACA territories continue to fill from the left A1 segment.  Feras Akbik, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

    "text": "DIAGNOSTIC CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM, SOLUMBRA THROMBECTOMY  CLINICAL INDICATION: This is a 45 years year old Male who presents with an acute stroke syndrome secondary to a right M1 occlusion.  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 30 minutes.  OPERATORS: [HCW], was the attending physician. He supervised the entire procedure. [HCW] was the fellow. Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right Internal Carotid Artery Right common femoral artery  ANESTHESIA: MAC. Pre-, intra-, and post-anesthesia monitoring records are available in the chart.  MEDICATIONS:  Verapamil 5mg Lidocaine 10cc Ancef 2 g IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 6 French Pinnacle Terumo Sheath (as a transitional dilator) 8 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 8 French Walrus balloon guide catheter 0.035\" Bentson Guidewire 0.035\" Bentson Guidewire, exchange length 5 French Simmons 3 Glide catheter Asahi 018 microguidewire Trak 21 microcatheter RED 68 Aspiration Catheter Trevo NXT 4 x 41 Stentriever device  Mynx closure device Omnipaque-300 contrast (80 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient's family (medical proxy). Specifically, the risks of intracranial or systemic hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, distal emboli, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, device malfunction, groin hematoma, arterial dissection/laceration, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite, intubated, and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; an 8 French sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery. The 8 French balloon guide-catheter and diagnostic catheter were introduced into the right common carotid artery as a system. A roadmap angiogram was completed of the common carotid artery to visualize the carotid bifurcation. The diagnostic catheter was then used to select the internal carotid artery over the guidewire. The balloon guide catheter was then advanced into the cervical internal carotid artery over the wire and diagnostic catheter. The wire and diagnostic catheter were then removed and the balloon guide was connected to a continual heparinized saline flush. Digital angiograms were performed centered over the head.   The initial TICI score was 2b secondary to a subocclusive clot in the proximal right M1 segment. Note was made of cervical ICA vasospasm . 5 mg intra-arterial verapamil was infused and a repeat run demonstrated improvement in the previously noted vasospasm.  A triaxial system of the aspiration catheter, microcatheter, and microguidewire were advanced into the internal carotid artery over roadmap guidance. The Trak 21 microcatheter and Asahi 018 microwire were then advanced through the aspiration catheter past the MCA occlusion. A microrun confirmed intravascular placement.  The aspiration catheter was then tracked to the face of the clot. The wire was removed from the microcatheter and replaced with the Trevo NXT 4 x 41 stentriever device.  The stentriever was deployed under fluoroscopy and the allowed to set in the clot for 5 minutes. The microcatheter was removed so that that the stentriever was \"naked\" in the aspiration catheter. The balloon on the guide catheter was then inflated. The stentriever was then removed under continuous aspiration using a 60cc syringe. Thrombus was  identified within the stentriever device.  The balloon on the guide was deflated and a cerebral angiogram was performed through the guide catheter. Recanalization of the MCA was achieved with revascularization of the distal territory consistent with TICI 2c.  An angiogram of the right common femoral artery was obtained; the artery was deemed not appropriate for use of the 8 French Angio-Seal closure device. The sheath was removed and hemostasis obtained by deployment of the Mynx closure device. A Tegaderm was then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: Non-invasive imaging, same day  FINDINGS:  RIGHT  INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: A subocclusive clot is noted in the proximal M1 segment of the right MCA consistent with TICI 2b.  Note is made of severe spasm in the cervical ICA just distal to the catheter tip.  RIGHT  INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL (post verapamil infusion): A subocclusive clot is noted in the proximal M1 segment of the right MCA consistent with TICI 2b.  There is markedly improvement of the spasm noted in the cervical ICA.  RIGHT  INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-THROMBECTOMY, 1st pass): Reperfusion has been reestablished consistent with TICI 2c. There is no residual narrowing of the right M1 segment.  RIGHT FEMORAL ARTERY: No abnormalities are detected. The catheter enters just distal to the bifurcation is therefore not suitable for an intravascular closure device.  COMPLICATIONS: none immediate.  IMPRESSION:  1. There is a subocclusive clot in the proximal right M1 segment of the MCA consistent with TICI 2b.  2. Status-post 1 pass thrombectomy with resultant TICI 2c. There is no residual narrowing of the right M1 segment.",

Specifically, the risks of intracranial or systemic hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, distal emboli, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, device malfunction, groin hematoma, arterial dissection/laceration, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite, intubated, and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; an 8 French sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery. The 8 French balloon guide-catheter and diagnostic catheter were introduced into the right common carotid artery as a system. A roadmap angiogram was completed of the common carotid artery to visualize the carotid bifurcation. The diagnostic catheter was then used to select the internal carotid artery over the guidewire. The balloon guide catheter was then advanced into the cervical internal carotid artery over the wire and diagnostic catheter. The wire and diagnostic catheter were then removed and the balloon guide was connected to a continual heparinized saline flush. Digital angiograms were performed centered over the head.   The initial TICI score was 1 secondary to a right M1 occlusion.  A triaxial system of the aspiration catheter, microcatheter, and microguidewire were advanced into the internal carotid artery over roadmap guidance. The Trak 21 microcatheter and Asahi 018 microwire were then advanced through the aspiration catheter past the M1 occlusion. A microrun confirmed intravascular placement.  The aspiration catheter was then tracked to the face of the clot. The wire was removed from the microcatheter and replaced with the Trevo NXT 4 x 41 stentriever device.  The stentriever was deployed under fluoroscopy and the allowed to set in the clot for 5 minutes. The microcatheter was removed so that that the stentriever was \"naked\" in the aspiration catheter. The balloon on the guide catheter was then inflated. The stentriever was then removed under continuous aspiration using a 60cc syringe. Thrombus was identified within the stentriever device and the aspirate.  The balloon on the guide was deflated and a cerebral angiogram was performed through the guide catheter. Recanalization of the MCA was achieved with revascularization of the distal territory consistent with TICI 3.  An angiogram of the right common femoral artery was obtained; the artery was deemed appropriate for use of the 8 French Angio-Seal closure device. The sheath was removed and hemostasis obtained by deployment of the 8 French Angio-Seal closure device. A Tegaderm was then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: Non-invasive imaging, same day  FINDINGS:  RIGHT  INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: A right M1 segment of the MCA occlusion is identified consistent with TICI 1.   RIGHT  INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-THROMBECTOMY, 1st pass):  Reperfusion has been reestablished consistent with TICI 3.   RIGHT FEMORAL ARTERY: No abnormalities are detected. This vessel is suitable for use of the 8 French Angio-Seal closure device.  COMPLICATIONS: none immediate.  IMPRESSION:  1. Right M1 occlusion with initial occlusion consistent with TICI 1.  2. Status-post 1 pass thrombectomy with resultant TICI 3.",

    "text": "DIAGNOSTIC CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM, SOLUMBRA THROMBECTOMY  CLINICAL INDICATION: This is a 49 years year old Male who presents with an acute stroke syndrome secondary to a right MCA occlusion.  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 30 minutes.  OPERATORS: [HCW], was the attending physician. He supervised the entire procedure. [HCW] was the fellow. Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right Internal Carotid Artery Right common femoral artery  ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia. Pre-, intra-, and post-anesthesia monitoring records are available in the chart.  Intubation was performed in part due to medical necessity  MEDICATIONS:  Ancef 2 g IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 6 French Pinnacle Terumo Sheath (as a transitional dilator) 8 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 8 French Walrus balloon guide catheter 0.035\" Bentson Guidewire 0.035\" Bentson Guidewire, exchange length 5 French Simmons 3 Glide catheter Asahi 018 microguidewire Trak 21 microcatheter RED 68 Aspiration Catheter 8 French Angio-Seal closure device Omnipaque-300 contrast (20 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient's family (medical proxy). Specifically, the risks of intracranial or systemic hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, distal emboli, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, device malfunction, groin hematoma, arterial dissection/laceration, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite, intubated, and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; an 8 French sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery. The 8 French balloon guide-catheter and diagnostic catheter were introduced into the right common carotid artery as a system. A roadmap angiogram was completed of the common carotid artery to visualize the carotid bifurcation. The diagnostic catheter was then used to select the internal carotid artery over the guidewire. The balloon guide catheter was then advanced into the cervical internal carotid artery over the wire and diagnostic catheter. The wire and diagnostic catheter were then removed and the balloon guide was connected to a continual heparinized saline flush. Digital angiograms were performed centered over the head.   The initial TICI score was 2b secondary to a M3 occlusion. Given the distal nature of the clot, no intervention was pursued.   An angiogram of the right common femoral artery was obtained; the artery was deemed appropriate for use of the 8 French Angio-Seal closure device. The sheath was removed and hemostasis obtained by deployment of the 8 French Angio-Seal closure device. A Tegaderm was then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: Non-invasive imaging, same day  FINDINGS:  RIGHT  INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: A right M3 occlusion is identified consistent with TICI 2b.   RIGHT FEMORAL ARTERY: No abnormalities are detected. This vessel is suitable for use of the 8 French Angio-Seal closure device.  COMPLICATIONS: none immediate.  IMPRESSION:  1. Following administration of TPA, the initially suspected right M1 occlusion was no longer present. The patient now had a distal right M3 segment occlusion consistent with TICI 2b. No intervention was pursued.",

DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 90 minutes.  OPERATORS: [HCW], was the attending physician. He supervised the entire procedure. [HCW] was the fellow. Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right Common Carotid Artery Right Internal Carotid Artery Right common femoral artery  ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia. Pre-, intra-, and post-anesthesia monitoring records are available in the chart.  Intubation was performed in part due to medical necessity  MEDICATIONS:  Heparin 5000 units IV Ancef 2 g IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 6 French Pinnacle Terumo Sheath (as a transitional dilator) 8 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 8 French Walrus balloon guide catheter 0.035\" Bentson Guidewire 0.035\" Bentson Guidewire, exchange length 5 French Merit Performa Vertebral catheter Asahi 018 microguidewire Trak 21 microcatheter RED 68 Aspiration Catheter Trevo NXT 4 x 41 Stentriever device  Mynx closure device Omnipaque-300 contrast (120 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient's family (medical proxy). Specifically, the risks of intracranial or systemic hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, distal emboli, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, device malfunction, groin hematoma, arterial dissection/laceration, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite, intubated, and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; an 8 French sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery. The 8 French balloon guide-catheter and diagnostic catheter were introduced into the right common carotid artery as a system. The diagnostic catheter was then used to select the internal carotid artery over the guidewire. The balloon guide catheter was then advanced into the cervical internal carotid artery over the wire and diagnostic catheter. The wire and diagnostic catheter were then removed and the balloon guide was connected to a continual heparinized saline flush. Digital angiograms were performed centered over the head.   The initial TICI score was 0 secondary to a right ICA supraclinoid occlusion.  A triaxial system of the aspiration catheter, microcatheter, and microguidewire were advanced into the internal carotid artery over roadmap guidance. The Trak 21 microcatheter and Asahi 018 microwire were then advanced through the aspiration catheter past the ICA occlusion. The aspiration catheter was then tracked to the face of the clot under continuous aspiration. The wire was removed from the microcatheter and replaced with the Trevo NXT 4 x 41 stentriever device.  The stentriever was deployed under fluoroscopy and the allowed to set in the clot for 5 minutes. The microcatheter was removed so that that the stentriever was \"naked\" in the aspiration catheter. The balloon on the guide catheter was then inflated. The stentriever was then removed under continuous aspiration using a 60cc syringe. Thrombus was  identified within the stentriever device and the aspirate.  The balloon on the guide was deflated and a cerebral angiogram was performed through the guide catheter. There is persistent occlusion of the supraclinoid ICA consistent with TICI 0.   A triaxial system of the aspiration catheter, microcatheter, and microguidewire were again advanced into the internal carotid artery over roadmap guidance. The Trak 21 microcatheter and Asahi 018 microwire were then advanced through the aspiration catheter past the ICA occlusion for second pass. The aspiration catheter was then tracked to the face of the clot under continuous aspiration. The wire was removed from the microcatheter and replaced with the Trevo NXT 4 x 41 stentriever device.  The stentriever was deployed under fluoroscopy and the allowed to set in the clot for 5 minutes. The microcatheter was removed so that that the stentriever was \"naked\" in the aspiration catheter. The balloon on the guide catheter was then inflated. The stentriever was then removed under continuous aspiration using a 60cc syringe. Thrombus was  identified within the stentriever device and the aspirate.  The balloon on the guide was deflated and a cerebral angiogram was performed through the guide catheter. Partial recanalization with occlusive clot in the M1 segment of the MCA and subocclusive clot in the A1 segment of the ACA consistent with TICI 1.   A triaxial system of the aspiration catheter, microcatheter, and microguidewire were again advanced into the internal carotid artery over roadmap guidance. The Trak 21 microcatheter and Asahi 018 microwire were then advanced through the aspiration catheter past the MCA occlusion for a third pass. The aspiration catheter was then tracked to the face of the clot under continuous aspiration. The wire was removed from the microcatheter and replaced with the Trevo NXT 4 x 41 stentriever device.  The stentriever was deployed under fluoroscopy and the allowed to set in the clot for 5 minutes. The microcatheter was removed so that that the stentriever was \"naked\" in the aspiration catheter. The balloon on the guide catheter was then inflated. The stentriever was then removed under continuous aspiration using a 60cc syringe. Thrombus was  identified within the stentriever device and the aspirate.  The balloon on the guide was deflated and a cerebral angiogram was performed through the guide catheter. There is recanalization of the MCA territory with reperfusion of the MCA territory consistent with TICI 2c. There is an occlusion at eh  a2-3 junction of the right ACA.  A triaxial system of the aspiration catheter, microcatheter, and microguidewire were again advanced into the internal carotid artery over roadmap guidance. The Trak 21 microcatheter and Asahi 018 microwire were then advanced through the aspiration catheter past the ACA occlusion for a fourth pass. The aspiration catheter was then tracked to the face of the clot under continuous aspiration. The wire was removed from the microcatheter and replaced with the Trevo NXT 4 x 41 stentriever device.  The stentriever was deployed under fluoroscopy and the allowed to set in the clot for 5 minutes. The microcatheter was removed so that that the stentriever was \"naked\" in the aspiration catheter. The balloon on the guide catheter was then inflated. The stentriever was then removed under continuous aspiration using a 60cc syringe. Thrombus was  identified within the stentriever device and the aspirate.  The balloon on the guide was deflated and a cerebral angiogram was performed through the guide catheter. There is recanalization of the ACA territory with reperfusion of the ACA territory consistent with TICI 3.   An angiogram of the right common femoral artery was obtained; the artery was deemed appropriate for use of a closure device. The sheath was removed and hemostasis obtained by deployment of the Mynx closure device. A Tegaderm was then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: Non-invasive imaging, same day  FINDINGS:  RIGHT  COMMON CAROTID ARTERY, CERVICAL: There is slow filling of the right internal carotid artery consistent with occlusion distal to the cervical ICA. The ECA branches opacify normally.  RIGHT  INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: A ICA terminus occlusion is identified consistent with TICI 0.  RIGHT  INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-THROMBECTOMY, 1st pass):  There remains slow filling of the right internal carotid artery consistent with occlusion of the supraclinoid ICA. This is consistent with TICI 0.   RIGHT  INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-THROMBECTOMY, 2nd pass):  There is occlusion of the M1 segment of the MCA with subocclusive clot in the A1 segment of the ACA. This is consistent with TICI 1.   RIGHT  INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-THROMBECTOMY, 3rd pass): Reperfusion has been reestablished in the MCA territory consistent with TICI 2c. Note is made of an occlusion of the a2-3 junction of the right ACA.   RIGHT  TOTAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-THROMBECTOMY, 4th pass): Reperfusion has been reestablished in the right ACA territory consistent with TICI 3. There is TICI 2c reperfusion of the right hemisphere.  RIGHT FEMORAL ARTERY: No abnormalities are detected. This vessel is suitable for use of the Mynx closure device.  COMPLICATIONS: none immediate.  IMPRESSION:  1. Right ICA occlusion with initial occlusion consistent with TICI 0.  2. Status-post 4 pass thrombectomy with resultant TICI 2c.",

    "text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Female Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL].[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  Retroperitoneal hematoma with hemorrhagic shock.  PROCEDURE:     1.\tUS-guided right common femoral artery access. 2.\tAortogram  3.\tL3 lumbar angioembolization 4.\tSelective angiography of the left T10, T11, and T12 intercostal arteries, the left L4 lumbar artery, the left external and internal iliac arteries, the left deep circumflex artery. 5.\tPost-embolization L3 angiography and completion aortogram 6.\tRight common femoral artery angiogram and closure  FINDINGS: ANGIOGRAPHY: Vessels catheterized using base catheter and microcatheter/microwire combination and angiograms performed:  Abdominal aorta: Generalized arterial vasospasm. Small foci of active hemorrhage arising from distal branches of the left L3 lumbar artery. T10 intercostal artery: No active hemorrhage. T11 intercostal artery: No active hemorrhage. T12 intercostal artery: No active hemorrhage.  L1 lumbar artery: Diminutive and not opacified on aortography. Unable to be catheterized L2 lumbar artery: Diminutive and not opacified on aortography. Unable to be catheterized L3 lumbar artery: Persistent focus of active extravasation along the distal and branch  L4 lumbar artery: No active hemorrhage  Left external iliac artery: No active hemorrhage Lateral proximal deep circumflex artery: No active hemorrhage Tiny branch external iliac extending to the left lower abdomen and flank: No active hemorrhage  Left internal iliac artery: No active hemorrhage  Post-embolization L3 artery angiography: Cessation of extravasation.  Transcatheter embolization: Embolic: Obsidio conformable embolic Details (type/size/volume/number): 0.10 mL  IMPRESSION:   Active extravasation noted arising from the distal L3 lumbar artery in the region of the left flank correlating with patient's known retroperitoneal hematoma.  Technically successful embolization of the left L3 lumbar artery.   TREATMENT PLAN:  1. Continued clinical and laboratory monitoring recommended. Please contact interventional radiology if there is a change in clinical status. 2. Routine post-angiography groin cares ordered. Maintain RLE straight for 2 hours  3. Continue resuscitation, correction of coagulopathy    TECHNIQUE: With the patient in the supine position, the groin was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. Following standard prepping and draping, the right common femoral artery was punctured using a needle. Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. Permanent recording and reporting of the saved image and study into the PACS system was performed. An 0.035\" wire was advanced into the aorta. A vascular sheath was placed over the wire into the common femoral artery. A side flush was started.  A 5-Fr Omni Flush diagnostic catheter was advanced over an 0.035\" wire into the abdominal aorta. Aortogram was performed as detailed above. Next, the Omni Flush was exchanged for a 5 French Mickelson catheter. The catheter was used to catheterize the vessels described above. Angiograms were performed. A 2.8 F Progreat microcatheter system and Asahi Meister microwire was used to catheterize distal vessels, as described above. Specific vessels catheterized.  Once the catheter was in adequate position, utilization was performed using Obsidio conformable embolic. Approximately 0.10 ml was introduced into the microcatheter and flushed using contrast to deliver the embolic to the desired location. Postembolization angiography was performed as detailed above.  Next, the Mickelson catheter was exchanged for the Omni Flush catheter. Using a 0.035'' wire the catheter was placed at the iliac bifurcation and used to advance a wire to the contralateral left external iliac artery. The Omni flush catheter was exchanged for a 5 French Cobra C2 glide catheter and advanced into the left external iliac artery. Angiography was performed as detailed above. Once again the microcatheter system was used to subselect vessels as detailed above. The Cobra C2 glide was then used to catheterize the left internal iliac artery. Angiography was performed as detailed above.  Finally, completion aortography was performed which demonstrates cessation of the previously noted active extravasation. No new areas of active extravasation are noted along the left flank.  All catheters and wires were removed from the patient. Hemostasis was achieved using vascular closure device, Angio-Seal. The site was dressed in usual fashion.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition without any immediate postprocedural complications.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Brandon Lei Fellow(s): Dr. Rameez Rehman Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 250 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 35.9 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  1143 mGy  Conscious Sedation: Sedation was provided via general anesthesia. For further details please refer to the anesthesia record.  Medications: For further details please refer to the anesthesia record.  Antibiotics: Patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Brandon Lei, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

    "text": "CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM WITH INTRA-ARTERIAL VERAPAMIL INFUSION FOR TREATMENT OF VASOSPASM  CLINICAL INDICATION: 75-year-old female with Hunt-Hess 1 subarachnoid hemorrhage from a ruptured V4 segment artery aneurysm with vasospasm on the basis of noninvasive imaging and trans-cranial doppler.  PROCEDURE: Diagnostic cerebral angiogram. Intra-arterial verapamil infusion in bilateral ICA.  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 90minutes.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician. He supervised the entire procedure. [HCW] was the fellow. Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Left vertebral artery Right internal carotid artery Left internal carotid artery  VESSELS TREATED: Right internal carotid artery Left internal carotid artery  ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia administered by anesthesia staff.   MEDICATIONS:  Heparin 5000 units IV 30 mg IA verapamil  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter Visipaque 270 contrast material (100 cc) Mynx closure device  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient's medical proxy. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, balloon rupture, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, heart block, hypotension, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery. A 5 French sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously after sheath placement; additional boluses of heparin were administered at one-hour intervals. Using fluoroscopic guidance, the above vessels was selectively catheterized with the 5 French diagnostic catheter. Digital angiograms were performed centered over the head. In the right and left internal carotid artery 15 mg of intra-arterial verapamil were administered using a pulse spray technique over 10 minutes on each side.   A follow-up control angiogram was performed in each of the right and left internal carotid arteries after infusion.  Following completion of the procedure, hemostasis was achieved by application of a Mynx closure device. A Tegaderm was then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: Cerebral angiogram dated 12/29/2023.  FINDINGS: LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: The previously treated giant vertebral artery segment aneurysm demonstrates mild compaction of coils when compared to angiogram from yesterday with filling at the base of the aneurysm.. The flow diverting stent is patent and without change in caliber throughout its length in the vertebral artery when compared to immediate post placement runs. There is no significant vasospasm noted in the posterior circulation. Reflux of contrast into the  contralateral vertebral artery was not achieved. The origin of left PICA is normal.  LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL (PRE-SPASMOLYSIS): There is moderate vasospasm noted throughout the MCA territory and severe vasospasm located in the left ACA territory both proximally and distally. There is delay of filling of the ACA territory as a result of this vasospasm.  LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL (IA SPASMOLYSIS): There is improvement of vasospasm throughout the MCA territory and is now mild in appearance. The ACA territory demonstrates some improvement and is now moderate in severity distally. There is no longer delayed filling of the ACA territory.  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL (PRE-SPASMOLYSIS): There is mild to moderate vasospasm noted throughout the MCA territory and severe vasospasm located in the right ACA territory both proximally and distally. There is delay of filling of the ACA territory as a result of this vasospasm.  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL (IA SPASMOLYSIS): No significant residual vasospasm noted in the right MCA territory. The ACA territory demonstrates some improvement and is now moderate in severity distally. There is no longer delayed filling of the ACA territory.  COMPLICATIONS: none immediate.  IMPRESSION:  1. The previously treated left vertebral artery segment aneurysm demonstrates mild compaction of coils when compared to angiogram from yesterday. The flow diverting stent in the vertebral artery is patent and unchanged in appearance.  2. There is severe vasospasm noted in the bilateral ACA territories which improved to moderate in the distal segments following IA verapamil and moderate vasospasm in the MCA territories which improved to mild following spasmolysis. Following intra-arterial spasmolysis, there was no longer delay in filling of the ACA territories bilaterally.",

Procedure:   1.\tTunneled central venous double-lumen Hickman catheter placement   2.\tLeft tunneled central venous line removal  Findings:   1.\tThe right internal jugular vein is sonographically patent and compressible.  2.\tAfter placement of the Hickman catheter, as described, the tip terminates in the right atrium. 3.\tPost surgical changes of thoracic and cervical rod and screw fixation 4.\tSuccessful left tunneled central venous line removal  Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a tunneled Hickman catheter.       Treatment Plan:   Routine catheter care.  The catheter is ready for immediate use.        Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed above.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS.  A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.  Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of a peel-away sheath.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The catheter was tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.   The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.         Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Kamil Arif Fellow(s): Dr. Kwaku Opoku Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: None  Fluoroscopy time: 1.0 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  2.4 mGy  Conscious Sedation: Please see separate anesthesia documentation.  Antibiotics: Rocephin, 2 g IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a power-injectable, 5 Fr, x 26 cm, tunneled non-cuffed central venous catheter via the right internal jugular vein (single lumen).    Treatment Plan:   Routine catheter care.  The catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed below.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a peel-away sheath set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture peel-away sheath set, the wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.  Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The port was tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Brandon Lei Fellow(s): Dr. Kwaku Opoku Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: None  Fluoroscopy time: 0.4 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  2.35 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 20 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       The attending radiologist, Brandon Lei, MD, was available for procedural supervision and interpreted the images.",

    "text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Male Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL].[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]  Clinical Indication:  Left ureteroileal anastomotic stricture managed with a modified left nephroureterostomy tube.   Procedure:  1. Left antegrade nephrostogram and percutaneous nephroureterostomy exchange.   Findings:  1. Left antegrade nephrostogram demonstrates unchanged distal ureteral stricture. 2. Newly placed modified PCNU is appropriately positioned with the proximal loop in the renal pelvis and catheter tip in the distal ureter.  Catheter:  10.2-Fr Cook nephroureterostomy tube, modified with the distal end cut  Impression:  Uneventful image-guided exchange of Left percutaneous nephroureterostomy tube.   Plan:   Patient will be due for routine exchange in 10-12 weeks.   Technique:  With the patient in prone position, the left flank was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. A scout radiograph was obtained.   Contrast was injected through the existing nephroureterostomy tube and imaging of the collecting was system performed. A 0.035\" wire was placed through the tube and the tube removed over the wire and discarded. A 5 French Kumpe catheter was negotiated over the wire into the distal ureter. After the wire was straightened out, a new, 10.2-French Cook modified nephroureterostomy tube was advanced over the wire under fluoroscopic guidance. The wire was removed and the proximal loop formed and locked in the renal pelvis. Contrast injection confirmed location.  The catheter was sutured to the flank and placed to gravity drainage. A sterile dressing was applied.    The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition without any immediate postprocedural complications.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s): [HCW] Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 30 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 2.9 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  16.9 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 30 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 2 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: Rocephin, 2 g IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Peter Park, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

Ultrasound and Fluoroscopic guided placement of a tunneled, cuffed central venous catheter  Findings:  1. The right internal jugular vein is ultrasonographically patent and normal. Vein patency and needle entry were stored to PACS. 2. The newly placed catheter has a smooth course with the tip terminating in the right atrium.  Impression:   Uneventful image guided placement of right internal jugular vein tunneled Trifusion catheter as described.  Technique:  The right neck and chest region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. The region was ultrasonographically evaluated.  Using local anesthetic and ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was punctured with a 21 gauge needle.  An image documenting vein patency and needle entry was saved and stored to PACS.   A 0.018” wire was passed centrally and the needle exchanged for a 5 French transitional dilator. A 0.035” wire was advanced through the dilator and negotiated into the IVC.  The skin tract was dilated and a 13 French dilator peel-away combination placed over the wire.  The soft tissues caudal and lateral to the sheath entry site were anesthetized with lidocaine with epinephrine. A dermatotomy was made and a tunneling tool brought from the dermatotomy to the venotomy. The catheter was brought through the tunnel.  During suspended respiration, the catheter was advanced through the peel-away and positioned centrally using fluoroscopy. The peel-away was removed and hemostasis achieved with manual compression.  The venotomy was closed with Dermabond and Steri-Strips applied. A single Prolene suture was placed at the catheter tunnel exit site. An antimicrobial disc and sterile dressing were applied.  The catheter was aspirated, flushed, and heparinized per protocol. The procedure was well tolerated, and the patient was discharged in satisfactory condition.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): None Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): [HCW]  Complications: No immediate complications.

An ultrasound image documenting vein patency was stored to PACS. 2.\tThe port catheter has a smooth course with the tip terminating near the cavoatrial junction.  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful placement of a tunneled right internal jugular 8 French single lumen Bard power Port-A-Cath using sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance.  Treatment Plan:   The catheter tip is in good position. The line flushes and aspirates appropriately.  The catheter is okay to use.  Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Sedation the anesthesia. Please refer to anesthesia notes for medication.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Subsequently, the right chest was anesthetized with lidocaine solution , both with and without epinephrine. An incision was made. A port pocket was created. The port reservoir was placed within the port pocket after adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The port was not affixed to the chest wall with suture.  The catheter was tunneled under the skin of the right  chest.   Under fluoroscopic guidance, a peel-away sheath was advanced through the venotomy site over a guide wire to the level of the right atrium. The catheter was inserted through the peel-away sheath and into the  internal jugular vein  via a peel-away sheath after removal of the dilator and wire. Static fluoroscopic image was obtained documenting the tip of the port catheter in good position near the cavoatrial junction. The port flushes and aspirates appropriately.   The port pocket was closed with buried, interrupted subcutaneous 3-0 absorbable sutures. A running 4-0 absorbable subcuticular stitch and  Dermabond was used to close the skin.  The access site was sealed with     Dermabond.   The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate post procedural complication.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): None Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): Hilary Karp, PA-C  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.4 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  23.22 mGy  Conscious Sedation: Please refer to anesthesia notes.  Medications: As refer to anesthesia notes  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I, Hilary Karp PA C. performed the procedure. Dr. D Prologo was the attending of record.",

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a 14 French,  20 cm, non-tunneled large bore central venous catheter via the right internal jugular vein.  Treatment Plan:   Routine catheter care. The catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Local anesthesia was used for this procedure   The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic. Ultrasound evaluation of the vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS. Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS.  A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, a 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of the catheter over the wire. The catheter was subsequently introduced over the wire and the wire removed. The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): None Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): [HCW]  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.3 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  1.89 mGy  Local anesthesia was used for this procedure   Medications: Versed 0 mg IV. Fentanyl 0 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I Hee Kang, PA, performed the above procedure, Dr. Peter Park was the attending of the day.",

Progressively increasing size of pneumothorax. Mal positioned chest tube.  Procedure:   Fluoroscopy guided drain placement of right pneumothorax  Findings:   1. Fluoroscopy images through the chest demonstrate appropriate percutaneous drainage.  Impression:   Technically successful fluoroscopy guided drainage of right thorax.  Treatment Plan:   1. Waterseal or continuous suction per plastic surgery protocol.  Technique:  Target: Right apical lung Imaging: Fluoroscopy Drain: 14 Fr 40 cm APD Drainage: 50 mL serosanguinous fluid aspirated during procedure. Complete aspiration of the air with resolved pneumothorax. Microbiology: N/A  A superficial skin entry site was selected based on available imaging and the overlying skin entry site was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier to target the above collection. The skin surface was anesthetized with 1-2% lidocaine. Using fluoroscopy imaging guidance, a needle was introduced into the target site, with imaging guidance confirming adequate positioning. The access device was utilized with an 0.035\" wire to introduce the drainage catheter listed above following any necessary serial dilatation. The catheter was secured to the skin surface using nonabsorbable suture material and dressed in typical fashion. Any samples not sent to laboratory for analysis were discarded. The patient tolerated the procedure and was sent to the recovery area for monitoring.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s):     Resident(s):     Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 1.8 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  17.91 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for anesthesia.   Medications: Please refer to the anesthesia documentation.  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.

    "text": "DIAGNOSTIC CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM  CLINICAL INDICATION: This is a 29 years Male past medical history of the left basal ganglia AVM status post radiation therapy and embolization, who reported recently worsening spasms in his lower extremities. He now presents for diagnostic cerebral angiography to evaluate his previously treated arteriovenous malformation.   PROCEDURE: Diagnostic cerebral angiogram.  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 30 minutes.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] was the fellow. Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Left internal carotid artery Left vertebral artery  ANESTHESIA: Local in the right groin with bupivacaine. Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by the nurse present during the entire procedure. The patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Sedation was administered by a specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for the duration of the procedure as outlined above (Total intra service time, 30 minutes ). Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Versed 1 mg IV Fentanyl 50 mcg IV Heparin 3000 units IV Protamine 20 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter  Visipaque-270 contrast material (40 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a 5 French Vascade closure device  followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Cerebral angiogram October 12, 2021.  FINDINGS:  LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is evidence of a subtle persistent shunt with arterial supply from the anterior choroidal artery and very slightly early venous drainage into the internal cerebral veins, slightly less conspicuous than prior angiogram. There is no evidence of focal stenosis or aneurysm.  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is very subtle evidence of early filling of the internal cerebral veins by the thalamic perforators arising from the basilar artery. This again appears less conspicuous than on prior angiogram. No aneurysm or focal stenosis was identified. Reflux of contrast into the contralateral vertebral artery was achieved. The origin of PICA is normal bilaterally.   COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: 1. Very subtle evidence of a persistent left basal ganglia early venous filling with supply from the left anterior choroidal artery and thalamic perforators arising from the basilar artery, overall slightly improved compared to prior angiogram.",

Vein patency was documented by ultrasound and stored to PACS. 2.  The catheter tip terminates near the cavoatrial junction.        Impression:   1.\tUneventful image guided placement of 5 French, 40 cm double-lumen PICC in the left  upper extremity as described. The lumens flush and aspirate appropriately.        Treatment Plan:   Catheter tip position is confirmed as above. It is OK to use this line.       Technique:   The site was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).   Ultrasound evaluation of the left basilic vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS. Local anesthetic was used over the access site. Under ultrasound guidance, the left basilic vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS.    A 0.018\" wire was passed centrally and the needle exchanged for a dilator peel-away combination. The wire was used to determine catheter length, and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line cut to appropriate length. The tailored catheter was advanced through the peel-away and positioned centrally using fluoroscopy.   The peel-away was removed, and hemostasis achieved with manual compression. The catheter was aspirated, flushed, and locked per protocol. It was secured in place with Ethilon.  An antimicrobial disc and sterile dressing were applied.  The procedure was well tolerated, and the patient discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.        Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s): None Resident(s): [HCW] Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.2 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  9 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for no sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure  Medications: Versed 0 mg IV. Fentanyl 0 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure. H&P was performed and consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Christian Allison Fauria-Robinson, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

Patient symptoms including heavy menses, dysmenorrhea, occasional pelvic pressure and unable to lay on her abdomen due to mass effect.  Symptoms for 5 years  PROCEDURE:   1.\tUltrasound-guided left radial artery access 2.\tPelvic angiography 3.\tUterine artery embolization 4.\tPost-embolization angiography  Findings:  Vessels catheterized and angiograms performed as detailed below:  Infrarenal abdominal aortogram: Internal iliac artery origins identified bilaterally. Evidence of right ovarian-uterine arterial supply.  Right internal iliac artery: Markedly enlarged uterine artery with a myomatous uterus identified. Right uterine artery: Fibroid blush identified. No cervical branches.   Left internal iliac artery: Markedly enlarged uterine artery with a myomatous uterus identified. Left uterine artery: Fibroid blush identified. No cervical branches.  Embolization:  Right uterine: 1. 5 vials 5-700 u EmboSpheres 2. 4 vials 7-900 u EmboSpheres  Left uterine: 1. 2 vials 5-700 u EmboSpheres 2. 2 vials 5-700 u EmboSpheres  Intra-arterial medication administration: Preservative-free lidocaine 5 mL given bilaterally. Toradol 15mg was given systemically after embolization of each side.  Hypogastric Nerve Block: N/a  Post-Embolization Angiograms: Right uterine artery: Sluggish flow without opacification of the uterine fibroids. Left uterine artery: Sluggish flow without opacification of the uterine fibroids.  Technical notes: Vert Catheter, 2.8 Progreat, Fathom, Double angled GT Glide.  Impression:  1. Enlarged uterine branches bilaterally with a leiomyomatous uterus, status post successful bilateral uterine artery embolization.  Treatment Plan:  1. The patient will be monitored for 4-6 hours to assess for the need for an observation admission for pain control. 2. Patient will be discharged with a stool softener/laxative, analgesic, anti-emetic, and a narcotic for pain control. 3. Patient will follow-up in clinic with IR in 2 weeks and 6 months.  Technique:  With the patient in the supine position, the left wrist was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. The left wrist was evaluated with ultrasound and left radial artery patency and acceptable size criteria were documented. Images were properly stored in PACS. A modified Allen test (Barbeau test Type A) was performed on the left wrist to confirm patency of the ulnopalmar arch using pulse oximetry.   1% lidocaine solution was administered for local anesthesia. Access was obtained to the left radial artery using a 21 gauge micro needle and ultrasound guidance. Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. Permanent recording and reporting of the saved image and study into the PACS system was performed. A wire was placed through the needle. A hydrophilic Glidesheath was advanced slowly over the wire. 3000 units of heparin, 200 mcg of nitroglycerin and 2.5 mg of verapamil was given through the arterial sheath with slow hemodilution. A side flush was started. Hypogastric nerve block, if utilized, is detailed above.  Diagnostic catheter and microcatheter were advanced through the sheath into the aorta and used to catheterize the bilateral internal iliac arteries and pelvic vessels described above. Angiograms were performed. Specific vessels catheterized and embolized are described in detail above. Post-embolization angiography was performed and described above.  All catheters and wires were removed from the patient. A TR Band was placed on the left wrist for hemostasis. The access sheath was removed and no hematoma was seen. A radial artery pulse was confirmed distal to the puncture site confirming patent hemostasis.   The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition without any immediate postprocedural complications.    Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Tina Sankhla Fellow(s): Dr. Kevin Beker Szomstein Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 250 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 38.3 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  1308 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 120 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 2 mg IV. Fentanyl 100 mcg IV. Toradol 30 mg IV, Zofran 4 mg IV, Dilaudid 0.5 mg IV  Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Tina Sankhla, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

    "text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Male Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL].IR.1  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  Transplant ureteral stricture. Failed stricture protocol, balloon ureteroplasty and cutting balloon ureteroplasty. Joint decision to pursue stenting over surgical repair.  Procedure:  1. Right antegrade nephrostogram and conversion to ureteral stent. 2. Placement of right percutaneous nephrostomy.   Findings:  1. Right antegrade nephrostogram demonstrates persistent long-segment ureteral stricture extending from the renal pelvis to the ureterovesicular anastomosis. Existing PCNU is clogged. 2. Newly placed JJ ureteral stent is appropriately positioned with the proximal loop in the renal pelvis and distal loop in the urinary bladder. 3. Successful placement of 8Fr Right PCN with cope loop in the renal pelvis.   Impression:  1. Successful conversion of right lower quadrant transplant PCNU to double-J ureteral stent. 2. Successful placement of right lower quadrant transplant safety PCN.  Plan:   1. Cap PCN and monitor clinical course. 2. Return to IR in 1-2 weeks once tolerating capping for repeat labs and PCN removal. 3. Patient given extensive uncapping guidelines, including but not limited to development of fevers, chills, difficulty urinating, dysuria, abdominal pain.   Technique:  With the patient in prone position, the bilateral flanks were prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. A scout radiograph was obtained.   A sample was obtained for cytology evaluation.Contrast was then injected through the existing nephroureterostomy tube and imaging of the collecting was system performed. This demonstrated persistent stricture with clogging of the tube in its mid to distal portions. Additionally, a bifid collecting system was noted with normal appearance of the upper and mid pole calyces, and an isolated lower pole pelvis draining separately into the proximal ureter.   A 0.035\" Glidewire advantage was placed through the tube into the bladder and the tube removed over the wire and discarded. An 8 French sheath was then advanced over the wire into the bladder. An additional Amplatz wire was advanced into the bladder as a safety wire.  The new 8 French by 12 cm Cook nephroureteral stent was then advanced over the wire under fluoroscopic guidance, and successfully deployed with the distal loop in the bladder, and the proximal loop in the renal pelvis.  Then over the Amplatz safety wire, a new 8 French nephrostomy tube was advanced with cope loop formed in the renal pelvis. It took quite a bit of maneuvering to appropriately position the newly placed PCN and JJ stent, however at the end of the procedure both were adequately positioned with contrast flowing through the stent into the bladder.  The new PCN was sutured to the soft tissues and placed to gravity drainage for initial decompression. A sterile dressing was applied.    The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition without any immediate postprocedural complications.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Peter Park Fellow(s): Dr. Joseph Henain Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 30 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 27.4 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  103 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 90 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 2 mg IV. Fentanyl 100 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: Rocephin, 2 g IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  Peter Park, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

    "text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Female Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL].[ID].[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  61-year-old with leiomyosarcoma of the colon in [DATE]. She underwent resection of transverse colon mass in [DATE]. Surveillance imaging [DATE] w/segment 5 liver lesion. Pt now with rapid progression in liver on MRI [DATE] and CT [DATE]. Plan for shunt study/mapping.  Additional Clinical Information: Hepatocellular carcinoma with intrahepatic tumors  PROCEDURE:  Y90 Shunt study/mapping using MAA  1. US-guided left radial artery access. 2. Diagnostic visceral angiography 3. MAA delivery Cone-beam CT performed for intraprocedural localization, as detailed below.   FINDINGS: ANGIOGRAPHY: Vessels catheterized and angiograms performed, as follows:  Superior mesenteric artery: No anatomic variant or vascular supply to the liver. Celiac artery: Tumoral blush identified. Anatomic variant with gastrohepatic trunk, common hepatic artery and splenic takeoff at the celiac plexus. Proper hepatic artery: Tumoral blush identified. Right hepatic artery: Tumoral blush identified.  Middle hepatic artery: Tumoral blush identified. Gastrohepatic artery: No tumoral blush identified.  There is right phrenic artery which comes off the celiac artery on celiac catheterization and angiogram, in retrospect, the vessel may possibly have a lateral branch vessel supply to right liver.   Specific technical notes / catheter selection: None  CBCT: Yes Catheter location: Proper hepatic hepatic artery Findings: Tumoral blush identified with supply from the target vessel.  Catheter location: Right hepatic artery Findings: Tumoral blush identified with supply from the target vessel.  Catheter location: middle hepatic artery Findings: Tumoral blush identified with supply from the target vessel  Embolization: No embolization was performed.  Vessel embolized: Will plan for coil embolization of the arterial supply to the caudate lobe prior to dose delivery for y-90 (series 5 image [DATE]/[DATE])  MAA delivery performed from: Proper hepatic artery (series 7 image [DATE]) Future target Y90 delivery catheter position(s): proper hepatic artery (Series 7 image [DATE]/[DATE]) Treatment device: SIRTEX Split-Dose: No Dosimetry Model: Partition dosed to the right lobe/segment. Desired lobar/tumoral (if partition) dose right lobe: maximum 40 Gy to unaffected liver   IMPRESSION:   Successful Yttrium-90 SIR-Spheres selective internal radiotherapy mapping.  TREATMENT PLAN:  1. Patient will return in 2-4 weeks for Y90 radioembolization. 2. Access site precautions and orders placed.  TECHNIQUE:  With the patient in the supine position, the left wrist was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. The left wrist was evaluated with ultrasound and left radial artery patency and acceptable size criteria were documented and images were properly stored in PACS. A modified Allen test (Barbeau test Type B) was performed on the left wrist to confirm patency of the ulnopalmar arch using pulse oximetry.   1% lidocaine solution was administered for local anesthesia. Access was obtained to the left radial artery using a 21 gauge micro needle and ultrasound guidance. Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. Permanent recording and reporting of the saved image and study into the PACS system was performed. A wire was placed through the needle. A hydrophilic Glidesheath was advanced slowly over the wire. 3000 units of heparin, 200 mcg of nitroglycerin and 2.5 mg of verapamil was given through the arterial sheath with slow hemodilution. A side flush was started.   A 5-Fr Sarah catheter was advanced over an 0.035\" wire into the abdominal aorta. The catheter was used to catheterize the visceral vessels described below. Angiograms were performed. A microcatheter system was used to catheterize distal visceral and hepatic vessels, as described above. Specific vessels catheterized and embolized are described in detail above. Tumor blush was confirmed on angiography.  Cone Beam CT (CBCT) was performed intraprocedurally for purposes of treatment planning, targeting and dose calculation. Axial and coronal images were created and 3D reconstruction was performed on a separate dedicated workstation under concurrent supervision.  After confirmation of target treatment vessel, 5 mCi of Tc-99 MAA was injected slowly in this location though the catheter.   All catheters and wires were removed from the patient. A TR Band was placed on the left wrist for hemostasis. The access sheath was removed and no hematoma was seen. A radial artery pulse was confirmed distal to the puncture site confirming patent hemostasis.   The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition without any immediate postprocedural complications. The patient was transferred to the Nuclear Medicine department for imaging.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Steven Citron Fellow(s): Dr. Kwaku Opoku Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 175 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 28.6 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  873 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 128 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 2 mg IV. Fentanyl 100 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Steven Citron, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

    "text": "DIAGNOSTIC CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM  CLINICAL INDICATION: This is a 62 years Male with past medical history of recurrent posterior circulation TIA, status post left vertebral artery stent, who developed a left PCA infarct, now on aspirin and clopidogrel, who presents for cerebral angiogram to evaluate vertebral artery stent integrity, who presents for diagnostic cerebral angiography   PROCEDURE: Diagnostic cerebral angiogram.  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 30 minutes.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] was the fellow. Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right common carotid artery Right subclavian artery Left common carotid artery Left subclavian artery  ANESTHESIA: Local in the right groin with bupivacaine. Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by the nurse present during the entire procedure. The patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Sedation was administered by a specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for the duration of the procedure as outlined above (Total intra service time, 30 minutes ). Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Versed 1.5 mg IV Fentanyl 75 mcg IV Heparin 3000 units IV Protamine 20 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter  5 French Vascade closure device Visipaque-270 contrast material (80 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a 5 French Vascade closure device  followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Non-invasive imaging.  FINDINGS: RIGHT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. There is evidence of mild intracranial atherosclerotic disease within the cavernous and supraclinoid internal carotid artery. The visualized ECA branches opacify normally.   RIGHT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY, CERVICAL: There is evidence of smooth atherosclerotic plaque however not resulting in stenosis at the proximal cervical internal carotid artery. There is mild stenosis of the proximal external carotid artery. The visualized ECA branches opacify normally.   RIGHT SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY,CERVICAL: The origin of the right vertebral artery is occluded. The right vertebral artery is reconstituted by muscular branches from the thyrocervical trunk beginning at the mid cervical segment. The remaining subclavian branches opacify normally. The right vertebral artery appears to end in PICA.   LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is mild atherosclerotic disease within the left cavernous and supraclinoid internal carotid arteries No aneurysm or early draining vein was identified.. The visualized ECA branches opacify normally.   LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY, CERVICAL: There is very mild stenosis at the proximal left internal carotid artery. The carotid bulb is smooth, without irregularity. There is mild stenosis at the proximal left external carotid artery.  LEFT SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY, CERVICAL: There is a stent visualized at the origin of the left vertebral artery with mild in-stent stenosis at the proximal end. The proximal and lateral end of the stent appears to project into the subclavian artery as a shelf.  LEFT SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY, CEREBRAL: The cervical vertebral artery opacifies normally. Reflux into the contralateral vertebral artery was not seen. There is mild intracranial atherosclerotic disease of the basilar artery. No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein was identified.  COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: 1. Mild in-stent stenosis at the proximal end of the left vertebral artery origin stent, not flow-limiting. 2. Chronic occlusion of the origin of the right vertebral artery, with reconstitution via muscular branches of the thyrocervical trunk. 3. Minimal carotid stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid arteries, with mild stenosis of the origins of the bilateral external carotid arteries..  Charles M Cawley, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

    "text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Male Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL]  ESRC[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  73 y.o. male with HTN, and COPD on daily inhalers with oxygen, was diagnosed with Hep B, Hep C, and HCC last [DATE]. He underwent cholecystectomy and partial hepatectomy ([DATE]) on [DATE]. He was subsequently started on Entecavir, and chemotherapy was initiated. His last infusion was in [DATE]. He had a restaging MRI on [DATE] which showed new bilobar lesions. He is referred to IR for liver directed therapy. [PATIENT] works full time as a Local veteran Employer Representative. He tells me he feels well, denies any issues with jaundice, abdominal pain, or ascites.  Additional Clinical Information: Hepatocellular carcinoma with intrahepatic tumors  PROCEDURE:   1. US-guided left radial artery access 2. Diagnostic visceral angiography 3. Right lobar radioembolization with Yttrium-90  FINDINGS: ANGIOGRAPHY: Vessels catheterized and angiograms performed, as follows:  Celiac artery: Tumoral blush identified. Right hepatic artery: Tumoral blush identified.  Specific technical notes / catheter selection: 2.8 Progreat, Run-through microwire  CBCT: No  Transcatheter embolization using Yttrium-90 microspheres performed from: Right hepatic artery (series 5, image 10.)  IMPRESSION:   Successful Yttrium-90 Sirspheres selective internal radiotherapy of th right hepatic lobe.  TREATMENT PLAN:  1. Patient will get repeat labs in 3 weeks with plan for interval left lobar Y90 treatment, 2. Access site precautions and orders placed.  TECHNIQUE:  With the patient in the supine position, the left wrist was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. The left wrist was evaluated with ultrasound and left radial artery patency and acceptable size criteria were documented and images were properly stored in PACS. A modified Allen test (Barbeau test Type B) was performed on the left wrist to confirm patency of the ulnopalmar arch using pulse oximetry.   1% lidocaine solution was administered for local anesthesia. Access was obtained to the left radial artery using a 21 gauge micro needle and ultrasound guidance. Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. Permanent recording and reporting of the saved image and study into the PACS system was performed. A wire was placed through the needle. A hydrophilic Glidesheath was advanced slowly over the wire. 3000 units of heparin, 200 mcg of nitroglycerin and 2.5 mg of verapamil was given through the arterial sheath with slow hemodilution. A side flush was started.   A 5-Fr Jacky/Sarah catheter was advanced over an 0.035\" wire into the abdominal aorta. The catheter was used to catheterize the visceral vessels described below. Angiograms were performed. A microcatheter system was used to catheterize distal visceral and hepatic vessels, as described below. Specific vessels catheterized and embolized are described in detail below. Tumor blush was confirmed on angiography.  Once the catheter was in adequate position, a pre-determined dose of 90-Yttrium radioactive particles was infused into the target hepatic artery. The microcatheter was flushed and the microcatheter was disposed of appropriately.   All catheters and wires were removed from the patient. A TR Band was placed on the left wrist for hemostasis. The access sheath was removed and no hematoma was seen. A radial artery pulse was confirmed distal to the puncture site confirming patent hemostasis.   The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition without any immediate postprocedural complications.   Additional Medications: Zofran 4 mg IV. Radial cocktail: Heparin 3,000U IA, Nitroglycerin 200 mcg IA, Verapamil 2.5 mg IA  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Tina Sankhla, Dr. Meghan Lilly Fellow(s): Dr. Kevin Beker Szomstein Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 60 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 29.5 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  120 mGy  Sedation: Please refer to anesthesia report for further details.   Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Tina Sankhla, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

    "text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Male Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL].[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  Central venous access needed to start AML treatment.    Procedure:   1.\tTunneled central venous catheter placement  Findings:   1.\tThe right internal jugular vein is sonographically patent and compressible.  2.\tAfter placement of the tunneled catheter, as described, the tip terminates near the cavoatrial junction.  Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a power-injectable, 5 Fr x 26 cm, tunneled non-cuffed central venous catheter via the right internal jugular vein - dobule lumen  Treatment Plan:   Routine catheter care.  The catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed below.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a peel-away sheath set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture peel-away sheath set, the wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.  Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.     Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Brandon Lei Fellow(s): Dr. Kwaku Opoku Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: None  Fluoroscopy time: 0.7 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  2.6 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 25 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.   Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       The attending radiologist, Brandon Lei, MD, was available for procedural supervision and interpreted the images.",

    "text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Female Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL].[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  43 y.o. female with recurrent progressive endocervical adenocarcinoma on tisotumab, history of radiation cystitis, and obstructive uropathy with R PCNU and L nephroureteral stent in place admitted for pain control and hematuria. CT A/P [DATE] demonstrates appropriately positioned R PCNU with decompressed collecting system with persistent mild to moderate left hydronephrosis despite indwelling stent. Urology recommending Left PCN insertion for improved decompression of left collecting system as it appears that patient has failed left stent. If possible, recommend retrieval of left stent during this procedure. May consider modified Left PCNU with tubing extending into the ureter but not full PCNU into bladder (stent curl in bladder may worsen patient's urinary symptoms and hematuria in the setting of radiation cystitis).    Procedure:   1.\tLeft nephrostogram and nephrostomy tube placement      Findings:  Comparison is made to a previous exam dated    .  1.\tSevere left hydroureteronephrosis under ultrasound evaluation  2.\tAntegrade nephrostogram demonstrates severe hydronephrosis with passage of contrast up to the mid ureter  Catheter(s):  10.2 F Cook nephrostomy tube  Impression:   1.\tUneventful ultrasound and fluroscopic-guided placement of a left nephrostomy tube as described above.      Treatment Plan:   Patient should return for routine check and change in 8-12 weeks.        Technique:   The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure and sedation were explained to the patient. Written informed consent was obtained.  A time out/call to order was performed prior to procedure initiation.  The soft tissues overlying the access site were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Ultrasound was utilized to identify an appropriate access site. Static ultrasound image was obtained and stored to PACS for reference purposes. Subsequently, under fluoroscopic and real-time concurrent ultrasound guidance, access was obtained into a posterior, inferior calyx using a 21 ga needle and a triaxial sheath system (Greb). Local anesthetic was injected at the catheter entry site. A wire was advanced centrally. Serial dilation was accomplished over the wire. The wire and inner dilator were removed. Non-ionic contrast was injected into the collecting system and images of the antegrade pyelogram were obtained and stored to PACS.  An 0.035” wire was advanced through the existing access. A nephrostomy tube was advanced over the wire and the Cope loop formed and locked in the renal pelvis. Contrast injection confirmed location. The catheter was sutured to the flank with monofilament suture and attached to gravity drainage. A sterile dressing was applied.  The procedure was well tolerated, and patient discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.        Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Meghan Lilly Fellow(s): Dr. Kevin Beker Szomstein Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 20 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 1.8 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  14 mGy  Conscious Sedation: Please refer to anesthesia report for further details.   Antibiotics: Rocephin, 2 g IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Meghan Lilly, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

The IVC is normal in caliber and without caval thrombus. Filter placed: Argon option elite Inferior vena cavogram post-deployment: Appropriate positioning below the renal veins without significant filter tilt. No evidence of thrombosis, perforation, or other complication.  Impression:   1.  Uneventful image guided placement of an infrarenal IVC filter.  Treatment Plan:  1. Patient will f/u in IR clinic in 3 months for consultation for possible filter removal. If tolerating anticoagulation before that time, contact IR for reevaluation for filter removal sooner.  Technique:   The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure and sedation were explained.  The specific risks of bleeding, infection, pulmonary embolism, filter maldeployment, and filter migration were detailed and accepted. Written informed consent was obtained. The patient was assessed for conscious sedation and found to be an adequate candidate. A dedicated nurse monitored heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation throughout the procedure. Patient was brought to the procedure suite and a time out was performed prior to procedure initiation. The right neck was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.   The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the access site were infiltrated with lidocaine for local anesthetic. Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency. Under continuous ultrasound guidance, with permanent recording and reporting, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018\" wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire. Through the micropuncture introducer set, an 0.035\" wire was advanced into the IVC under fluoroscopic guidance. A sheath was placed at the access site, as detailed. A catheter and/or sheath combination was advanced into the IVC and cavography was then performed, with findings detailed above.  Under direct fluoroscopic guidance, the filter described above was positioned and deployed through the delivery system. A repeat venogram was performed, documenting appropriate positioning.  All instruments and devices were removed and hemostasis achieved with manual compression. No immediate complication occurred, and the patient was discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Tina Sankhla Fellow(s): Dr. Kevin Beker Szomstein Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 20 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 3.9 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  291 mGy  Conscious Sedation: Local lidocaine only.  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Tina Sankhla, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

    "text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Female Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL][ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:   67 y.o. female with biopsy proven left renal angiomyolipoma s/p embolization on [DATE] presents angiography and embolization of residual AML.   PROCEDURE:   1. US-guided left radial artery access 2. Left renal angiography 3. Arterial embolization of third order vessels feeding the angiomyolipoma on the left kidney 4. Post-embolization angiography  FINDINGS: ANGIOGRAPHY: Vessels catheterized using base catheter and microcatheter/microwire combination and angiograms performed:  Left renal artery: Arterial supply to the angiomyolipoma with tumoral blush. First segmental arterial branch supplying the angiomyolipoma: Tumoral blush identified. Capsular arterial branch supplying the angiomyolipoma: Tumoral blush identified. Post-embolization artery supplying the angiomyolipoma angiography: Stasis of contrast and completed pruning of branches supplying the angiomyolipoma.  CBCT performed for the purpose of vessel guidance   Transcatheter embolization: Vessel 1: Segmental third order lower pole artery supplying the angiomyolipoma Embolic: Ethanol +lipiodol (3:1) Details (type/size/volume/number): 5 mL ethanol:lipiodol  Vessel 2: capsular arterial branch supplying the angiomyolipoma Embolic: Ethanol + lipiodol (3:1) and 250 Embozene Details (type/size/volume/number): 1 mL ethanol:lipiodol and 1 mL of suspended 250 Embozene particles.   IMPRESSION:   Technically successful ethanol:lipiodol and particle embolization of the arteries supplying the left renal angiomyolipoma.   TREATMENT PLAN:  1. Continued clinical and laboratory monitoring recommended. Please contact interventional radiology if there is a change in clinical status. 2. Band to be removed in 1.5 hours per protocol.  TECHNIQUE:  With the patient in the supine position, the left wrist was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. The left wrist was evaluated with ultrasound and appropriate left radial artery access criteria were documented. A modified Allen test (Barbeau test) was performed on the left wrist to confirm patency of the ulnopalmar arch using pulse oximetry.  1% lidocaine solution was administered for local anesthesia. Access was obtained to the left radial artery using a 21 gauge needle and ultrasound guidance. Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. Permanent recording and reporting of the saved image and study into the PACS system was performed. A wire was placed through the needle. A hydrophilic Glidesheath was advanced slowly over the wire. 3000 units of heparin, 200 mcg of nitroglycerin and 2.5 mg of verapamil was given through the arterial sheath with slow hemodilution. A side flush was started.   A 5-Fr RAVI catheter was advanced over an 0.035\" wire into the aorta. The catheter was used to catheterize the vessels described above. Angiograms were performed. A microcatheter system was used to catheterize distal vessels, as described above. Specific vessels catheterized and embolized are described in detail above.  Once the catheter was in adequate position, embolization was performed using the parameters detailed above. Post-embolization angiography was performed, as detailed above.  All catheters and wires were removed from the patient. A band was placed on the left wrist for hemostasis. The access sheath was removed and no hematoma was seen. A radial artery pulse was confirmed distal to the puncture site confirming patent hemostasis.   The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition without any immediate postprocedural complications.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Meghan Lilly Fellow(s): Dr. Kevin Beker Szomstein Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 105 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 23.6 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  2123 mGy  Conscious Sedation: Please refer to anesthesia report for further details.   Antibiotics: Levaquin, 500 mg IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Meghan Lilly, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

    "text": "CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM AND COIL EMBOLIZATION OF ANTERIOR COMMUNICATING ARTERY ANEURYSM    CLINICAL INDICATION: 54 years-year-old Male with PMH of remote TBI, tobacco use, and daily alcohol use who was brought to medical attention after he was found unresponsive. CT head revealed diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and CTA demonstrated an anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Diagnostic cerebral angiogram and treatment of ruptured aneurysm is indicated.  PROCEDURE: Cerebral angiogram, coil embolization of an anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: 2 hours.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician.  He supervised the entire procedure. [HCW] and [HCW] were the fellows. Each actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS CATHETERIZED: Right external carotid artery Right internal carotid artery Right vertebral artery Left internal carotid artery Left external carotid artery Right anterior cerebral artery Anterior communicating artery  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right common femoral artery Right external carotid artery Right internal carotid artery Right vertebral artery Left internal carotid artery Left external carotid artery   VESSELS TREATED (in sequence): Anterior communicating artery  ANESTHESIA:   General Anesthesia administered by anesthesiology staff.  Pre- Intra- and post- anesthesia records are available in the patient chart.   MEDICATIONS GIVEN:  Heparin 7000 units IV Aspirin 300 mg PR Protamine 25 mg IV Ancef 2 gram IV  MATERIALS USED:  5 French micropuncture kit Cope mandrel wire 5 French transitional dilator 6 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 6 French 65cm Arrow sheath 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 0.035\" Terumo glidewire  5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter 6 French Sofia guide catheter Headway 17 Advanced microcatheter Transcend-EX microguidewire Asahi 014 microguidewire 7 mm x 4 mm Hyperform balloon microcatheter 4 mm x 15 mm Scepter XC balloon microcatheter Omnipaque 300 contrast material (150 cc) Perclose ProGlide closure device  COILS: Framing coil: Optimax complex 7 mm x 20 cm Filling coils:  Optimax complex 6 mm x 11 cm Optimax complex 4.5 mm x 10 cm Optima complex-10 3 mm x 8 cm Optima complex-10 3 mm x 6 cm Optima complex-10 3 mm x 6 cm Optima complex-10 3 mm x 4 cm  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, hemorrhage, renal failure, limb loss, death, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.  After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion after intubation by the anesthesiology team. Access to the vascular system was gained by a single-wall puncture of the right common femoral artery. An angiogram of the right common femoral artery was performed through the outer cannula the dilator in order to ensure appropriate location of the arteriotomy and suitability of the artery for use of closure device. A 6 French short sheath was introduced into the right common femoral artery  using Seldinger technique. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously. Using fluoroscopic guidance, the 5 French diagnostic catheter was used to select the bilateral internal carotid arteries and the left vertebral artery.  Digital angiograms were performed of these vessels, centered over the head. Ipsilateral and contralateral oblique projections were obtained of both internal carotid artery injections to evaluate for anterior communicating or MCA bifurcation aneurysms.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the mid cervical segment of the right internal carotid artery for better delineation of the intracranial vasculature. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.  Following the diagnostic angiogram, an aspirin rectal suppository (300 mg) and an additional 2000 units of heparin IV were administered in preparation for coiling. A CTs were checked and additional heparin boluses were administered as needed in order to maintain an ACT between 250 and 300. The 6 French short Terumo sheath was exchanged over a Bentson wire for a 6 French 65 cm arrow long sheath. The diagnostic catheter and Bentson guidewire were advanced through the arrow sheath and used to select the right internal carotid artery. The arrow sheath was advanced into the right common carotid artery. The diagnostic catheter and Bentson guidewire were removed. The Sofia guide catheter was advanced over the Terumo Glidewire through the error sheath, and under roadmap guidance was advanced into the right internal carotid artery just proximal to the tonsillar loop. The Terumo Glidewire was withdrawn.  The balloon was then prepared on an adjacent table, and the microguidewire and the balloon were passed coaxially through the guide catheter into the 6 French Sofia catheter. The microcatheter and microwire and Hyperform balloon were advanced past the cervical into the ascending petrous portion of the right internal carotid artery. The Sofia catheter was advanced over these into the petrous segment of the right ICA. We attempted to advance the Hyperform balloon into the ACA, but was difficult to push and there seemed to be friction with the headway catheter. It was therefore removed and replaced with a scepter xc balloon which was advanced into the right ACA and positioned over the neck of the aneurysm without difficulty. Superselective catheterization of the anterior communicating artery aneurysm performed with the microcatheter over a microguidewire.   The aneurysm was framed and filled with the aforementioned coils using roadmap and blank roadmap technique. After the first several coils were placed within the aneurysm we withdrew the microcatheter from the aneurysm and reaccessed the aneurysm in order to more completely fill the aneurysm. The balloon was left in place in case of aneurysm rupture, but was not inflated during the case.   A final cerebral angiogram was done in the AP and lateral projection to evaluate for residual filling, and distal emboli.  Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Ancef was administered.  Hemostasis was achieved by application of a Perclose ProGlide. A Tegaderm was then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: None.  FINDINGS: RIGHT COMMON FEMORAL ARTERY: The arteriotomy is above the bifurcation of the right common femoral artery and the diameter of the vessel is adequate for a Perclose ProGlide.  RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a saccular aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery, the dimensions of which are described on 3-D rotational angiogram discussed below. No other aneurysms are identified. There is a tortuous tonsillar loop. No focal stenosis or early draining vein are identified.   RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Reflux of contrast into the  left vertebral artery was achieved. The origin of PICA is normal bilaterally.   LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Again there is seen a tortuous tonsillar loop.  LEFT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-EMBOLIZATION): There is a dense coil pack within the body of the aneurysm with no appreciable ongoing contrast opacification within the aneurysm. There are no perfusion deficits to suggest distal emboli in the distal circulation.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE right internal carotid artery:  3-D rotational angiography demonstrated a lobulated, narrow neck anterior communicating artery aneurysm which measures 7.8 x 7.6 x 6.7 x 2.9 mm (axial by axial by neck-to-dome by neck). This is the source of the patient's subarachnoid hemorrhage.    COMPLICATIONS: None.  IMPRESSION: 1. There is a lobulated, narrow neck anterior communicating artery aneurysm which measures 7.8 x 7.6 x 6.7 x 2.9 mm (axial by axial by neck-to-dome by neck). This is the source of the patient's subarachnoid hemorrhage. 2. Successful coil embolization of the above aneurysm with dense coil pack and no evidence of ongoing aneurysmal filling. 3. No other aneurysms were identified 4. Bilateral tonsillar loops of the internal carotid arteries.",

    "text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Male Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL]  ESRC[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  Renal cell carcinoma with musculoskeletal metastases, right hip involvement, high perioperative bleeding risk  PROCEDURE:   1. US-guided left common femoral artery access. 2. Pelvic angiography 3. Arterial embolization 4. Post-embolization angiography 5. Left common femoral artery angiogram and closure  FINDINGS: ANGIOGRAPHY: Vessels catheterized using base catheter and microcatheter/microwire combination and angiograms performed:  Infrarenal abdominal artery: Torturous abnormal small distal branches in the area of the right hip joint. Right obturator artery: Better demonstrated tortuous abnormal distal branches with abnormal parenchymal blush in the area of known right acetabular soft tissue mass. Post-embolization right obturator artery angiography: Near stasis, with no further abnormal parenchymal blush or filling of abnormal distal tortuous small arterial branches. Post embolization right internal iliac artery, anterior division: No evidence of significant remaining arterial supply to right acetabular lesion. Post embolization right internal iliac artery, posterior division: No evidence of significant remaining arterial supply to right acetabular lesion. Post embolization right internal iliac artery, multiple projections: No evidence of significant remaining arterial supply to right acetabular lesion.  Transcatheter embolization: Vessel 1: Right obturator artery  Embolic: Particles Details (type/size/volume/number): 3/4 vial Embospheres 300-500 micron  IMPRESSION:   Technically successful particle embolization of right acetabular soft tissue mass.  TREATMENT PLAN:   Routine post-angiography groin cares ordered. Clinical history for surgery tomorrow with orthopedic surgery.  TECHNIQUE: With the patient in the supine position, the groin was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. Following standard prepping and draping, the left common femoral artery was punctured using a needle. Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. Permanent recording and reporting of the saved image and study into the PACS system was performed. An 0.035\" wire was advanced into the aorta. A vascular sheath was placed over the wire into the common femoral artery. A side flush was started.  A 5-Fr diagnostic catheter was advanced over an 0.035\" wire into the abdominal aorta. A 5 French Omni Flush catheter was used for initial angiography and to navigate into the right pelvis. This was later exchanged for a 5 French Cobra glide catheter. The catheter was used to catheterize the vessels described above. Angiograms were performed. A 2.8 French microcatheter system was used to catheterize distal vessels, as described above. Specific vessels catheterized and embolized are described in detail above.  Once the catheter was in adequate position, embolization was performed using the parameters detailed. Post-embolization angiography was performed, as detailed.  A left common femoral artery angiogram was performed, demonstrating appropriate vascular access above the profunda femoris artery bifurcation. All catheters and wires were removed from the patient. Hemostasis was achieved using Angio-Seal closure device. The site was dressed in usual fashion.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition without any immediate postprocedural complications.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Zachary Louis Bercu, Dr. Janice Newsome Fellow(s): Dr. Ross Bittman Resident(s):     Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 90 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 11.4 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  1287 mGy  Anesthesia: Refer to anesthesia documentation  Medications: Refer to anesthesia documentation  Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  10-50 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Zachary Bercu, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

Spine MRI/bone-scan is within 30 days of this procedure and was performed on [DATE]. Patient has severe back pain despite optimal non-surgical management with severe impact of vertebral body compression fracture(s) on daily functioning. Patient has kyphotic deformity due to vertebral body compression fracture(s).    Procedure:   1.\tImage-guided kyphoplasty  2.\tImage-guided bone biopsy  3.\tImage-guided radiofrequency ablation of bone mass  Findings:   1.\tPre-intervention: Redemonstrated L4 compression deformity. 2.\tPost-intervention:  Successful deposition of cement within the treated vertebral body/bodies with no evidence of extravasation.    Impression:   1.\tSuccessful image guided augmentation of vertebral levels: T11 and L4, with biopsy of T11 and radiofrequency ablation performed at both levels.  Treatment Plan:   Physical therapy as tolerated.  Technique:   The patient was brought to the interventional radiology suite and placed on the table in prone position. The wide area of the back around the affected area(s) was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.   All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines). A scout image was obtained in AP and lateral projections.   Skin was anesthetized with a 2% lidocaine solution.   Level by level technique:   -Vertebral level:  T11     -Pedicle access:  Bipedicular -Access trocar gauge:  11-gauge -Balloon utilized:  15 mm  Prior to injection of cement, balloons were inserted and inflated under biplane fluoroscopy.  Static fluoroscopic images were stored to PACS documenting balloon utilization and position. -Biopsy obtained:  Yes -Indication for biopsy: Lytic lesion within the vertebral body -Ablation Performed: Stryker Optablate radiofrequency ablation, within the vertebral body bilaterally and within the right pedicle -Indication for Ablation: Pathologic Compression Fracture with Assosciated Pain  -Vertebral level:  L4     -Pedicle access:  Bipedicular -Access trocar gauge:  11-gauge -Balloon utilized:  20 mm  Prior to injection of cement, balloons were inserted and inflated under biplane fluoroscopy.  Static fluoroscopic images were stored to PACS documenting balloon utilization and position. -Biopsy obtained:  no -Indication for biopsy: NA -Ablation Performed: Stryker Optablate radiofrequency ablation, within the vertebral body and pedicles bilaterally -Indication for Ablation: Pathologic Compression Fracture with Assosciated Pain  Additional Procedural Details:   Utilizing AP, oblique and lateral fluoroscopy, needles were inserted into the affected vertebral body/bodies. Needles were advanced under careful, intermittent biplane fluoroscopy to ensure that the medial wall of the pedicle was not violated prior to transgression of the needle tip into the posterior wall of the vertebral body. The drill was then advanced to the anterior one-third of the vertebral body on each side.     Balloon(s) was/were inserted into the effected vertebral body/bodies and inflated under fluoroscopy. Static fluoroscopic images were stored to PACS documenting balloon position. Cement was mixed and balloons were removed after being deflated.  Cement was then injected under careful, intermittent biplane fluoroscopy to ensure no significant extravasation of PMMA cement beyond the borders of the vertebral body. Cement injection was stopped once there was adequate fill of the vertebral body. Trochars were removed with hemostasis obtained with focal compression. Static fluoroscopic images were obtained after removal of all needles documenting final cement position.    Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Christian Fauria-Robinson Fellow(s): Dr. Ross Bittman Resident(s): Kimani Hicks Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 24.3 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  1667 mGy  Anesthesia: Refer to anesthesia documentation  Medications: Refer to anesthesia documentation  Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.      Christian Allison Fauria-Robinson, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

    "text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Female Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL].[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  69-year-old female with UTI sepsis secondary to right staghorn calculus.  Procedure:   1.\tRight nephrostogram and nephrostomy tube placement      Findings:    1.\tMild hydronephrosis survey ultrasound.  2.\tStaghorn calculus visualized pelvis. Spontaneous contrast flow into the bladder.  Catheter(s):  8.5 F Cook nephrostomy tube  Impression:   1.\tUneventful ultrasound and fluroscopic-guided placement of a right nephrostomy tube as described above.      Treatment Plan:   Patient should return for routine check and change in 12 weeks.        Technique:   The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure and sedation were explained to the patient. Written informed consent was obtained.  A time out/call to order was performed prior to procedure initiation.  The soft tissues overlying the access site were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Ultrasound was utilized to identify an appropriate access site. Static ultrasound image was obtained and stored to PACS for reference purposes. Subsequently, under fluoroscopic and real-time concurrent ultrasound guidance, access was obtained into a posterior, inferior calyx using a 21 ga needle and a triaxial sheath system (Neff). Local anesthetic was injected at the catheter entry site. A wire was advanced centrally. Serial dilation was accomplished over the wire. The wire and inner dilator were removed. Non-ionic contrast was injected into the collecting system and images of the antegrade pyelogram were obtained and stored to PACS.  An 0.035” wire was advanced through the existing access. A nephrostomy tube was advanced over the wire and the Cope loop formed and locked in the renal pelvis. Contrast injection confirmed location. The catheter was sutured to the flank with monofilament suture and attached to gravity drainage. A sterile dressing was applied.  The procedure was well tolerated, and patient discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.        Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s):     Resident(s):     Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 10 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 5.5 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  41.25 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for anesthesia.   Medications: Please refer to the anesthesia documentation.  Antibiotics: Rocephin, 2 g IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

US-guided left radial artery access 2. Diagnostic visceral angiography 3. Selective internal radioembolization with Yttrium-90 4. Cone-beam CT performed for intraprocedural localization, as detailed below.  FINDINGS: ANGIOGRAPHY: Vessels catheterized and angiograms performed, as follows:  Celiac artery: Tumoral blush identified. Right hepatic artery: Tumoral blush identified.se 25 Right hepatic artery: Tumoral blush identified. se 22 Right hepatic artery: Tumoral blush identified. se 42   Specific technical notes / catheter selection: None  CBCT: Yes Catheter location: Right hepatic artery Findings: Tumoral blush identified with supply from the target vessel.  Gelfoam embolization with the intention to protect distally performed from right hepatic artery se21  Transcatheter embolization using Yttrium-90 microspheres performed from: Right hepatic artery (series 42, 22, 25   IMPRESSION:   Successful Yttrium-90     selective internal radiotherapy of a segments 5 and 8 hepatocellular carcinomas.  TREATMENT PLAN:  1. Patient will return to clinic in 6-8 weeks with abdominal MRI and labs.  2. Access site precautions and orders placed.  TECHNIQUE:  With the patient in the supine position, the left wrist was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. The left wrist was evaluated with ultrasound and left radial artery patency and acceptable size criteria were documented and images were properly stored in PACS. A modified Allen test (Barbeau test B) was performed on the left wrist to confirm patency of the ulnopalmar arch using pulse oximetry.   1% lidocaine solution was administered for local anesthesia. Access was obtained to the left radial artery using a 21 gauge micro needle and ultrasound guidance. Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. Permanent recording and reporting of the saved image and study into the PACS system was performed. A wire was placed through the needle. A hydrophilic Glidesheath was advanced slowly over the wire. 3000 units of heparin, 200 mcg of nitroglycerin and 2.5 mg of verapamil was given through the arterial sheath with slow hemodilution. A side flush was started.   A 5-Fr Jacky/Sarah catheter was advanced over an 0.035\" wire into the abdominal aorta. The catheter was used to catheterize the visceral vessels described below. Angiograms were performed. A microcatheter system was used to catheterize distal visceral and hepatic vessels, as described below. Specific vessels catheterized and embolized are described in detail below. Tumor blush was confirmed on angiography.  Cone Beam CT (CBCT) was performed intraprocedurally for purposes of treatment planning, targeting and dose calculation. Axial and coronal images were created and 3D reconstruction was performed on a separate dedicated workstation under concurrent supervision.  Once the catheter was in adequate position, a pre-determined dose of 90-Yttrium radioactive particles was infused into the target hepatic artery. The microcatheter was flushed and the microcatheter was disposed of appropriately.   All catheters and wires were removed from the patient. A TR Band was placed on the left wrist for hemostasis. The access sheath was removed and no hematoma was seen. A radial artery pulse was confirmed distal to the puncture site confirming patent hemostasis.   The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition without any immediate postprocedural complications.   Additional Medications: Benadryl 50 mg IV, Decadron 8 mg IV, Zofran 4 mg IV. Radial cocktail: Heparin 3,000U IA, Nitroglycerin 200 mcg IA, Verapamil 2.5 mg IA  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Meghan Lilly Fellow(s):     Resident(s):     Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 150 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 38.7 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  3384 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of     minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 2 mg IV. Fentanyl 150 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Dialysis fistula malfunction. Needs access for HD.  Procedure:   1.\tNon-tunneled large bore central venous catheter placement  Findings:   1.\tThe left internal jugular vein is sonographically patent and compressible.  2.\tHickman catheter on the right. 3.\tAfter placement of the large bore central venous catheter, as described, the tip terminates in the right atrium.  Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a 14 French,  20 cm, non-tunneled large bore central venous catheter via the left internal jugular vein.  Treatment Plan:   Routine catheter care. The catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).    The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the left internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic. Ultrasound evaluation of the vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS. Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS.  A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, a 0.035 Amplatz wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of the catheter over the wire. The catheter was subsequently introduced over the wire and the wire removed. The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s): [HCW] Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 1.1 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  1.5 mGy  Conscious Sedation: None administered  Medications: Local lidocaine only.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  Bryan N Swilley, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

Extensive scarring in the right groin 2.\tAfter placement of the large bore central venous catheter, as described, the tip terminates in the IVC.  Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a 14 French,  30 cm, non-tunneled large bore central venous catheter via the right common femoral vein.  Treatment Plan:   Routine catheter care. The catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed above.   The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right common femoral vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic. Ultrasound evaluation of the vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS. Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS.  A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, a 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of the catheter over the wire. The catheter was subsequently introduced over the wire and the wire removed. The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s): None  Resident(s): [HCW] Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.2 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  1.13 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 60 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 2 mg IV. 1 mg Dilaudid  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

    "text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Male Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL].[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  End-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis access. Known central venous stenoses.  Procedure:   1.\tBilateral upper extremity to central venography 2.\tInferior vena cavagram 3.\tUS evaluation of the right internal jugular vein 4.\tConversion of left femoral vein vascath to permcath  Findings:   1.\tOcclusion of the bilateral brachiocephalic veins with sluggish flow towards the heart via collaterals. 2.\tPatent IVC with large filling defects in the infrarenal IVC and bilateral common iliac veins corresponding to non-occlusive thrombosis demonstrated on recent cross-sectional imaging.  3.\tDistal right IJ thrombus as also seen on recent cross-sectional imaging. 4.  Successful conversion of preexisting left groin vascath to 55cm permcath, terminating near the inferior cavoatrial junction.  Catheter is ready to use.  Impression:   1. Right internal jugular and iliocaval acute thromboses. 2. Bilateral brachiocephalic venous occlusion, with extensive collaterals. 3. Successful placement of left common femoral venous tunneled hemodialysis catheter.  Treatment Plan:   1. Routine catheter care. 2. The catheter is ready for immediate use. 3. Therapeutic anticoagulation recommended.  Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed above.  Bilateral upper extremity central venography was performed by contrast injection into previously placed peripheral intravenous catheters under fluoroscopy with findings as detailed above. The right internal jugular vein was evaluated with ultrasound and permanent images stored to PACS.  The skin and subcutaneous tissues surrounding the indwelling left common femoral venous nontunneled catheter were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic. Contrast was injected into this catheter and images were stored. After local anesthetic was injected, a new 55 cm PermCath was tunneled through the skin of the thigh towards the venotomy site. A 0.035 inch stiff Amplatz wire was advanced through the indwelling catheter, and the indwelling catheter was removed over the wire. A peel-away sheath was advanced over the wire. The new catheter was advanced through the peel-away sheath into the inferior vena cava.  The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.  The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Brandon Lei Fellow(s): Dr. Ross Bittman Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 50 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 2.2 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  14 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 33 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. 150 mcg IV.  Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  50-100 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Brandon Lei, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

They could not find the ureteral orifice.  Procedures: 1. US guided calyceal access   2. Right antegrade pyelography  3. Right percutaneous nephroureteral catheter placement  Findings: Outside CT of the abdomen and pelvis from [DATE] was reviewed  1. There is mild to moderate right hydroureteronephrosis with high-grade obstruction at the UVJ. 2. Hydronephrosis and needle entry images into the right posterior interpolar calyx were stored to PACS. Urine returned was clear. 3. The 8.5 French by 28 cm nephroureteral catheter has its proximal cope loop in the renal pelvis and its distal cope loop in the urinary bladder.    Impression:   Uneventful image guided placement of an 8.5 French by 28 cm nephroureteral catheter as described.  Treatment plan:  Routine exchange in 8 weeks  Catheter should be flushed every 6 hours until urine clears. Then daily flushes will be adequate.   Technique:  Right nephroureteral catheter placement:  1% lidocaine was used as local anesthetic. Under direct ultrasound guidance a 10 cm 22 Chiba needle was introduced into the posterior interpolar calyx.  Entry was documented and images were stored to PACS. An 0.018\" wire was passed through the needle into the renal pelvis. The needle was removed and a 6 French coaxial dilator was placed over the wire.  Urine was aspirated and discarded. Antegrade pyelography was performed.    A 4 French angled glide catheter and Glidewire were placed coaxially through the transitional dilator and access to the bladder achieved. Contrast injection confirmed location. An Amplatz wire was placed and coiled in the bladder.   The dilator was removed and an 8.5 French by 28 cm  nephroureteral catheter was advanced over the wire. The distal cope loop was formed in the urinary bladder and the proximal Cope loop  was formed within the renal pelvis.  The catheter was anchored to the skin utilizing 2-0 Ethilon and attached to gravity drainage. A sterile dressing was applied.  The procedure was well-tolerated, and the patient was discharged still asleep into the care of anesthesiology for transfer to the PACU.    Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Gail Peters Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 20 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 2.1 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  27 mGy  Conscious Sedation: The procedure was performed under general anesthesia with intubation.  Antibiotics: 2 g IV Rocephin  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

    "text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Female Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL].[ID].1  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  Previously ruptured RCC in the right kidney. Ongoing hematuria with anemia.  PROCEDURE:   1. US-guided left radial artery access 2. Visceral angiography 3. Arterial embolization 4. Post-embolization angiography  FINDINGS: ANGIOGRAPHY: Vessels catheterized using base catheter and microcatheter/microwire combination and angiograms performed:  Right renal artery: No active hemorrhage. Anterior division right renal artery: No active hemorrhage. No pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula. Retropelvic right renal artery: No active hemorrhage. No pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula. Right inferior pole segmental artery: Tumoral blush identified. No active extravasation. Post-embolization right renal inferior pole segmental artery angiography: Nonopacification of tumor blush.  Transcatheter embolization: Vessel 1: Right renal inferior pole segmental renal artery Embolic: Ethanol/lipiodol Details (type/size/volume/number):  1:1 ratio ethanol:lipiodol Total 0.7 cc delivered  IMPRESSION:   1.\tTechnically successful ethanol embolization of tumor blush supplied by the right renal inferior pole artery. 2.\tNo angiographic findings of active arterial bleeding, arteriovenous fistula, or pseudoaneurysm in the right kidney.  TREATMENT PLAN:  1. Continued clinical and laboratory monitoring recommended. Please contact interventional radiology if there is a change in clinical status. 2. Extended TR band protocol. To be removed in 2 hours. Left-hand neurovascular checks Q1 hours for 4 hours.  3. Plan to discuss a followup ablation of known renal mass in IR clinic.  TECHNIQUE:  With the patient in the supine position, the left wrist was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. The left wrist was evaluated with ultrasound and appropriate left radial artery access criteria were documented. A modified Allen test (Barbeau test) was performed on the left wrist to confirm patency of the ulnopalmar arch using pulse oximetry (Barbeau B).  1% lidocaine solution was administered for local anesthesia. Access was obtained to the left radial artery using a 21 gauge needle and ultrasound guidance,. Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. Permanent recording and reporting of the saved image and study into the PACS system was performed. A wire was placed through the needle. A hydrophilic Glidesheath was advanced slowly over the wire. 3000 units of heparin, 200 mcg of nitroglycerin and 2.5 mg of verapamil was given through the arterial sheath with slow hemodilution. A side flush was started.   A 5-Fr RAVI MG1 catheter was advanced over an 0.035\" Bentson wire into the aorta. The catheter was used to catheterize the right renal artery as detailed above. Multiple angiograms were performed both from the main renal artery, and subselective interlobar renal arteries. No active extravasation, pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula identified. The right inferior pole segmental artery was then subselectively catheterized using a 2.4 Progreat microcatheter/Asahi Meister microwire combination.   Angiogram was performed from the microcatheter which demonstrated tumor blush. The above embolization was then performed. A postembolization angiogram demonstrated no further flow to the tumor. This same microcatheter/microwire combination was then used to subselectively catheterize any remaining interlobar arteries, without any abnormality identified.  An upward going capsular branch arising from the main renal artery was then catheterized, and angiogram again demonstrated no active extravasation or abnormality.   All catheters and wires were removed from the patient. A band was placed on the left wrist for hemostasis. The access sheath was removed, and a developing hematoma was noted proximally to the TR band (up on the forearm). An additional large TR band was attempted to be applied over the hematoma, however unsuccessful. Coban wrap was then used to wrap the forearm. Radial pulse was still palpable, with preserved waveform and oxygen readings.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Peter Park Fellow(s): Dr. Joseph Henain Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: Access site complication as above.   Contrast: 100 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 25.5 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  113.3 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 90 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  Peter Park, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a tunneled Hickman catheter.       Treatment Plan:   Routine catheter care.  The catheter is ready for immediate use.        Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed above.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS.  A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.  Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of a peel-away sheath.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The catheter was tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.   The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.         Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Tina Sankhla Fellow(s): Dr. Rameez Rehman Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: None  Fluoroscopy time: 0.4 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  2.67 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 30 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 0.5 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.   Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Tina Sankhla, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

    "text": "DIAGNOSTIC CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM, POSSIBLE PREOPERATIVE TUMOR EMBOLIZATION  CLINICAL INDICATION: This is a 31 years Male who developed left eye blurry vision no evidence found to have a large sphenoid wing mass. He is now planned to undergo surgical resection and presents for diagnostic cerebral angiography and possible tumor position.   PROCEDURE: Diagnostic cerebral angiogram, possible preoperative tumor embolization  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 60 minutes.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] and [HCW] were the fellow. [HCW] was the resident.  Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right internal carotid artery Right external carotid artery Left internal carotid artery Left external carotid artery Left vertebral artery Left ascending pharyngeal artery  ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia was administered under the supervision of the attending anesthesiologist. Pre-, intra-, and post-anesthesia monitoring records are available in the chart.  MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Heparin 3000 units IV Protamine 20 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter  Headway 17 advanced straight microcatheter Transend-EX microguidewire Omnipaque-300 contrast material (80 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   After reviewing the angiograms, we identified that the tumor supply was predominantly via the bilateral internal carotid arteries without safe target that would result in a high field embolization. We selectively catheterize the left ascending pharyngeal artery using a headway 17 microcatheter over the transcend microguidewire. We performed an angiogram of the left ascending pharyngeal artery. The left ascending pharyngeal artery supplied a very minor portion of the tumor and it was felt that embolization of this branch would not result in a significant decrease in tumor blush overall. At this point the procedure was concluded.  Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a 5 French Vascade closure device  followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Noninvasive imaging.  FINDINGS: RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. There is a tumor blush present, supplied primarily by the meningohypophyseal trunk of the right internal carotid artery.  RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula. No tumor blush is present.  LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. There is a large hypervascular tumor blush present, centered at the left sphenoid wing, supplied predominantly by the inferolateral trunk of the left internal carotid artery.  LEFT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula. There is a small amount of tumor blush supplied by the ascending pharyngeal artery.  LEFT ASCENDING PHARYNGEAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a small amount of tumor blush supplied by a distal superior pharyngeal branch of the left ascending pharyngeal artery.  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Reflux of contrast into the contralateral vertebral artery was achieved. The origin of PICA is normal bilaterally. No tumor blush is present.  COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: 1. There is a large hypervascular tumor centered at the left sphenoid wing supplied predominantly by the inferolateral trunk of the left internal carotid artery, with additional supply from the meningohypophyseal trunk of the right internal carotid artery and the left ascending pharyngeal artery. No targets for safe and high yield embolization were identified.",

Impression:   1.\tTechnically successful insertion of 15,5 French  tunneled abdominal ascites drain.       Treatment Plan:   The catheter may be used immediately.      Technique:   Informed consent for the procedure was obtained, and time-out was performed prior to the procedure.  The skin overlying the access site was subsequently prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).   The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right lower quadrant were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the abdomen was performed demonstrating large volume ascites.  Under ultrasound guidance, peritoneal space was accessed with a 5 French Yueh needle.         Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the upper anterior abdomen to the dermatotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the dermatotomy site.  The peritoneal access site was dilated to allow introduction of a peel-away sheath.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  Static fluoroscopic image was obtained documenting the catheter tip over the right, upper abdomen. The dermatotomy site was closed with a resorbable suture and Dermabond.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.   The catheter was connected to suction and 5 liters of clear, yellow fluid was drained from the peritoneal cavity. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate post procedural complication.        Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 1.4 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  7.6 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 40 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 0.5mg IV. Fentanyl 50mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Needle entry was documented. 4.\tPressures:  Free hepatic vein: 3 mm Hg Wedged hepatic vein: 8 mm Hg HVPG: 5 mm Hg (normal)   Right atrium: 5 mm Hg   Impression:   Successful image guided transjugular liver biopsy. Corrected sinusoidal pressure of 5 mm Hg.    Treatment Plan:  Follow up pathology results.  Technique:   The procedure, options, and risks were reviewed with patient, including bleeding, infection, and pneumothorax. A time out was performed before initiating the procedure.  The skin overlying the access site was subsequently prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines). Patient sedation was performed, as detailed below.  The right neck was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Using local anesthetic and ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was punctured with a 21 gauge needle with permanent reporting and recording. An image documenting vein patency and needle entry was stored and transferred to PACS. A 9 French sheath was placed at the neck.  An angled catheter was used to select the right hepatic vein and hepatic venography performed using nonionic contrast. Free and wedged hepatic pressures were obtained using a Fogarty balloon.  A 0.035” wire was placed in the hepatic vein and the 7 French Cook biopsy cannula was advanced over the wire. The wire was removed, and 3 passes made with the 18 gauge coaxial needle.  The specimen was placed in formalin and delivered to the laboratory.  The cannula and sheath were removed and hemostasis achieved with manual compression. No immediate complication occurred, and the patient was discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s): [HCW] Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 20 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 7.1 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  18 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 68 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 2 mg IV. Fentanyl 100 mcg IV.  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Brandon Lei, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a  16 French, 23 cm (tip-to-cuff), tunneled large bore central venous catheter via the right internal jugular vein.  Treatment Plan:   1. Routine catheter care. 2. The catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed above.  The skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the vein were infiltrated with 1% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the dialysis catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of a peel-away sheath.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Steven Faerstain, MD  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL   Fluoroscopy time: 1.8 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  9.79 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 20 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 0.5 mg IV. Fentanyl 25 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: Ancef, 1 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Routine exchange  Procedure:   1.\tRight nephrostogram(s) and nephrostomy tube replacement  Comparison: Previous exam [DATE]  Findings:    1.\tExisting nephrostomy tube(s) in appropriate position on scout radiograph. 2.\tNephrostography demonstrates hydronephrosis without drainage into the urinary bladder.   Catheter:  10.2 F Cook nephrostomy tube(s)  Impression:   1.\tUneventful image-guided nephrostomy tube re-placement.  Treatment Plan:   Patient should return for routine check and change in 6-8 weeks.  Technique:   The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure and sedation were explained to the patient. Written informed consent was obtained. A time out/call to order was performed prior to procedure initiation.  The existing catheter(s) and surrounding soft tissues were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines). Local anesthetic was injected at the catheter entry site. A scout radiograph was obtained.  Non-ionic contrast was injected through the existing nephrostomy tube(s) and images of the collecting system obtained and stored to PACS.  An 0.035” wire was advanced through the nephrostomy tube. The tube was removed over the wire under direct fluoroscopic visualization. A new nephrostomy tube was advanced over the wire and the Cope loop formed and locked in the renal pelvis. Contrast injection confirmed appropriate location. The catheter was sutured to the flank with monofilament suture and attached to gravity drainage. A sterile dressing was applied.  The procedure was well tolerated, and patient discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.    Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 40 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.8 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  10.8 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 40 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Vein patency was documented by ultrasound and stored to PACS. 2.  The catheter tip terminates in the right atrium.        Impression:   1.\tUneventful image guided placement of 5 French, 40 cm double-lumen PICC in the left upper extremity as described. The lumens flush and aspirate appropriately.        Treatment Plan:   Catheter tip position is confirmed as above. It is OK to use this line.       Technique:   The site was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).   Ultrasound evaluation of the left basilic vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS. Local anesthetic was used over the access site. Under ultrasound guidance, the left basilic vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS.     A 0.018\" wire was passed centrally and the needle exchanged for a dilator peel-away combination. The wire was used to determine catheter length, and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line cut to appropriate length. The tailored catheter was advanced through the peel-away and positioned centrally using fluoroscopy.   The peel-away was removed, and hemostasis achieved with manual compression. The catheter was aspirated, flushed, and locked per protocol. It was secured in place with Ethilon.  An antimicrobial disc and sterile dressing were applied.  The procedure was well tolerated, and the patient discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.        Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s): None Resident(s): [HCW] Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 1.4 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  9 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 40 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Performed under local anesthesia  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

The right nephrostomy tube is in appropriate position on scout radiograph. 2.\tLeft nephrostogram demonstrates no significant hydronephrosis with contrast passing down the ureter.   Catheter:  10.2 F Cook nephrostomy tube  Impression:   1.\tUneventful image-guided left nephrostomy tube re-placement.  Treatment Plan:   Patient should return for routine check and change in 6-8 weeks.  Technique:   The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure and sedation were explained to the patient. Written informed consent was obtained. A time out/call to order was performed prior to procedure initiation.  The surrounding soft tissues were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines). Local anesthetic was injected at the catheter entry site. A scout radiograph was obtained.  Through the left nephrostomy tract, a stiff Glidewire and Kumpe catheter were utilized to access the left collecting system. Non-ionic contrast was injected through the Kumpe catheter and images of the collecting system obtained and stored to PACS. The stiff Glidewire was exchanged for an Amplatz guidewire. A new nephrostomy tube was advanced over the wire and the Cope loop formed and locked in the upper pole calyx with sideholes extending to the renal pelvis. Contrast injection confirmed appropriate location. Patient declined suturing of the catheter to the flank. The catheter was attached to gravity drainage. A sterile dressing was applied.  The procedure was well tolerated, and patient discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW]  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 20 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 2.9 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  45.36 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 20 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: Rocephin, 2 g IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

    "text": "CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM AND ENDOVASCULAR PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION OF A RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY ANEURYSM  CLINICAL INDICATION: 61-year-old gentleman with a history of tobacco use and an incidentally discovered right vertebral artery aneurysm which was first noted on evaluation for a transient episode of global amnesia. Given the size and location of the aneurysm, as well as the patient's age and health status, treatment is indicated.  PROCEDURE:  1.\tCerebral angiogram  2.\tEndovascular pipeline embolization  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 1.5 hours.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] and [HCW] were the fellows. Each actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS CATHETERIZED: Right vertebral artery  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right radial artery (roadmap) Right subclavian artery Right vertebral artery  VESSELS TREATED (in sequence): Right vertebral artery  ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. Pre-, intra-, and post-anesthesia monitoring records are available in the chart.  MEDICATIONS:  Nitropaste Heparin 5000 units (1000 units IA - right radial artery, 4000 units IV) Nitroglycerin 200 mcg IA (right radial artery) Verapamil 2.5 mg IA (right radial artery)   MATERIALS:  6 French Terumo slender sheath with introducer kit 0.035\" Terumo Glidewire (180 cm) 5 French Sofia guide catheter (115 cm) Phenom 27 microcatheter (150 cm) Asahi 018 microguidewire (200 cm) 6 mm x 20 mm pipeline vantage embolization device TR band Omnipaque-300 contrast (100 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, stent thrombosis/stenosis, stent migration, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, non-target embolization, puncture site hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite, intubated, and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Ultrasound evaluation of the right radial artery was performed prior to prepping and draping. The radial artery was visualized using ultrasound from the distal wrist to its origin. The radial artery was patent throughout it's course from the wrist with origin from the brachial artery. Prior to prepping a small amount of Nitropaste was applied over the course of the radial artery on the distal wrist. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right radial artery under ultrasound guidance. The introducer wire was visualized within the radial artery using ultrasound. The course of the introducer wire was also visualized using fluoroscopy. Once we were satisfied that the introducer wire was well positioned within the radial and brachial artery, the 6 French Terumo slender sheath was advanced into the right radial artery over the introducer wire. Through the Terumo slender sheath, a roadmap angiogram of the of the right radial artery was obtained to evaluate for radiolucent and to ensure that there are no problems with the access site. A radial \"cocktail\" of 1000 units of heparin, 200 mcg of nitroglycerin, and 2.5 mg of verapamil were administered slowly through the Terumo slender sheath into the right radial artery. An additional 4000 units of heparin were administered IV. ACT checks were performed and additional heparin boluses were administered as needed in order to achieve a ACT of 250-300.  The 5 French Sofia catheter over a Terumo Glidewire were advanced through the radial sheath, and under fluoroscopic guidance were advanced into the proximal subclavian artery. An angiogram of the right subclavian artery was performed ordered to visualize the origin of the right vertebral artery. Using fluoroscopic guidance the vertebral artery was selected using the Terumo Glidewire, and the Sofia catheter was advanced over the Terumo Glidewire into the distal V2 segment of the right vertebral artery. Digital angiograms were performed in the AP and lateral projections centered over the head and neck.   3D rotational angiography was performed with the Sofia catheter in the distal V2 segment of the right vertebral artery to better delineate the intracranial vasculature. The acquisition was processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.   A working projection was obtained to best demonstrate the neck of the right vertebral artery aneurysm, as well as, the distal and proximal landing zones for the stent. Superselective catheterization of the distal vertebral artery was performed with the Phenom 27 microcatheter over the Asahi 18 microguidewire. The tip of the microguidewire was situated in the distal V4 segment of the right vertebral. The microguidewire in the phenom catheter was then exchanged for a 6 mm x 20 mm pipeline embolization device. The device was deployed under fluoroscopic guidance and a single shot X-ray was performed to confirm that the distal and proximal ends of the pipeline embolization device were in the right vertebral artery, just proximal to the origin of the anterior spinal artery and the V3 segment, respectively. Postprocessing of the pipeline embolization device was not needed.  A final AP and Lateral angiogram were completed to evaluate the distal vasculature for perfusion deficits and emboli.   After completion of the procedure, the sheath was removed and hemostasis obtained using a TR band.  COMPARISON: Angiograms dated 9/18/2023 and 7/24/2023.  FINDINGS:  RIGHT SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY: The origin of the vertebral artery, mammillary artery, and thyrocervical and costocervical trunks are visualized. The aneurysm of the V4 segment of the right vertebral artery is better visualized on the dedicated vertebral artery runs discussed below. Otherwise, the course and caliber of the the visualized portions of these vessels and their branches are normal in course and caliber.  RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: Grossly unchanged right vertebral artery aneurysm which arises just distal to the origin of the PICA. The anterior spinal artery originates from the right vertebral artery distal to the aneurysm.    RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION): There is a small region along the inferior aspect of the midportion of the stent as it crosses over the turn in the vertebral artery that is not quite apposed to the artery. The Pipeline device is otherwise well apposed to the vessel walls throughout it's course. The device does not cover the origin of the anterior spinal artery. Stasis of contrast is noted within the aneurysm. . No perfusion deficits to suggest distal emboli are present.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY: A 3D rotational angiogram of the  right vertebral artery was completed and post-processed on an independent work station. 3D angiography revealed grossly stable wide necked aneurysm of the vertebral artery which originates just distal to and separate from the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. This imaging was obtained primarily for acquisition of appropriate treatment views as well as sizing of device.   COMPLICATIONS: none immediate.  IMPRESSION:  1.\tGrossly stable widening aneurysm of the right vertebral artery which originates just distal to but separate from the PICA. 2.\tSuccessful placement of pipeline vantage embolization device in the right vertebral artery covering the above aneurysm with resulting contrast stagnation within the aneurysm.",

Treatment Plan:   Patient should return for routine check and change in 8-12 weeks.        Technique:   The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure and sedation were explained to the patient. Written informed consent was obtained.  A time out/call to order was performed prior to procedure initiation.  The soft tissues overlying the access site were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Ultrasound was utilized to identify an appropriate access site. Static ultrasound image was obtained and stored to PACS for reference purposes. Subsequently, under fluoroscopic and real-time concurrent ultrasound guidance, access was obtained into a posterior, inferior calyx using a 21 ga needle and a triaxial sheath system (Neff). Local anesthetic was injected at the catheter entry site. A wire was advanced centrally. Serial dilation was accomplished over the wire. The wire and inner dilator were removed. Non-ionic contrast was injected into the collecting system and images of the antegrade pyelogram were obtained and stored to PACS.  An 0.035” wire was advanced through the existing access. A nephrostomy tube was advanced over the wire and the Cope loop formed and locked in the renal pelvis. Contrast injection confirmed location. The catheter was sutured to the flank with monofilament suture and attached to gravity drainage. A sterile dressing was applied.  The procedure was well tolerated, and patient discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.        Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW]uck Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 40mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 5.9inutes Fluoroscopy dose:  38mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 40minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. Fentanyl 50mcg IV.      Antibiotics: Rocephin, 2 g IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Vein patency was documented by ultrasound and stored to PACS. 2.  The catheter tip terminates near the cavoatrial junction.        Impression:   1.\tUneventful image guided placement of 5 French, 43 cm double-lumen PICC in the left or right upper extremity as described. The lumens flush and aspirate appropriately.        Treatment Plan:   Catheter tip position is confirmed as above. It is OK to use this line.       Technique:   The site was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).   Ultrasound evaluation of the right basilic vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS. Local anesthetic was used over the access site. Under ultrasound guidance, the right basilic vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS.    A 0.018\" wire was passed centrally and the needle exchanged for a dilator peel-away combination. The wire was used to determine catheter length, and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line cut to appropriate length. The tailored catheter was advanced through the peel-away and positioned centrally using fluoroscopy.   The peel-away was removed, and hemostasis achieved with manual compression. The catheter was aspirated, flushed, and locked per protocol. It was secured in place with Ethilon.  An antimicrobial disc and sterile dressing were applied.  The procedure was well tolerated, and the patient discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.   Procedural Personnel Advanced practice provider(s): [HCW]  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 1.6 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  15.06 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 0 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 0 mg IV. Fentanyl 0 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I Lindsay Greco, ACNP, performed the above procedure, Dr. Tina Sankhla was the attending of the day.",

    "text": "Patient's Name: [PATIENT]  MRN: [ID] Procedure date: [DATE].  IR PERIPHERAL PICC  Indications: The patient is planned for long-term IV antibiotics.  Request is made for PICC placement.  Procedure: After explaining the technique, risks, benefits, alternatives, and answering all questions, informed consent was obtained from the patient. Timeout identifying the correct patient, procedure, site, allergies was performed and observed by the operating team. The patient was positioned supine with the right  arm abducted and resting on an arm board. The procedure is performed under continuous physiologic monitoring. The right arm and elbow region were prepped with by chlorhexidine and draped in a sterile fashion.  Following temporal application of a tourniquet across the right  axilla administration of local anesthesia using lidocaine 1% with epinephrine 2 ml, under ultrasound  guidance, access was obtained into the right brachial vein using a micropuncture device. Of note, the basilic vein is small in caliber. A 0.018\" guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy centrally into the SVC. Over the guidewire, a peel-away sheath was advanced. Following removal of the guidewire, a the available 5 F double  lumen power PICC was advanced through the sheath after trimming to a length of 45 cm. The sheath was peeled away and the line was further advanced with the tip at the SVC/upper right atrium. Both  lumens  demonstrated easy aspiration and injection and were  flushed with hep saline per protocol. Hemostasis was secured. Sterile occlusive dressing was applied including a Biopatch.  The PICC is ready to use. The patient tolerated to the procedure well. There were no intraprocedural complications. The patient was transferred to recovery in stable condition and eventually discharged. Please also refer to the Procedure note placed in the patient's EPIC chart on the date of the procedure.  Fluoroscopy time: 00:18.3 min.  Device implanted: LOT # [ID] , REF # [ID]   Recommendations: Routine PICC care.  Fellows: None. Residents: None.  IMPRESSION: 1. Uneventful right  arm power  PICC placement. The PICC is ready to use.  Voice recognition is used in generating this report.",

    "text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Female Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL].[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  Acute on chronic liver failure. Possible hepatorenal syndrome. Need for HD.  Procedure:   1.\tTunneled large bore central venous catheter placement. 2.\tRemoval of pre-existing nontunneled central venous catheter.  Findings:   1.\tThe right internal jugular vein is sonographically patent and compressible.  2.\tAfter placement of the large bore central venous catheter, as described, the tip terminates in the right atrium.  Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a  15.5 French, 19 cm (tip-to-cuff), tunneled large bore central venous catheter via the right internal jugular vein.  Treatment Plan:   1. Routine catheter care. 2. The catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed above.  The skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle. An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 Nitrex wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 Amplatz wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the dialysis catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The venotomy tract was serially dilated to allow introduction of a peel-away sheath.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Kamil Arif Fellow(s): Dr. Joseph Henain Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 4.8 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  22 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 60 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 2 mg IV. Fentanyl 100 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  Kamil Arif, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

Hand injection of the drain does not communicate with the biliary tree. 2.\tNewly placed biliary drain is appropriately positioned with the distal tip in the central left hepatic duct.  Impression:   Uneventful image guided replacement of the biliary catheter as described.  Treatment Plan:   Leave the drain to gravity bag.   Technique:   The existing catheter and surrounding soft tissues were prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Local anesthetic was injected at the catheter entry site.  Hand injection of contrast was performed, however, the catheter no longer communicating with the biliary tree. The catheter was cut and removed. A 5 French Kumpe catheter was introduced into the tract and manipulated centrally. Eventually the left hepatic bile ducts were entered and the Kumpe catheter was advanced centrally over a Glidewire. The Glidewire was removed and an Amplatz wire was placed. A new 10 French Dawson-Mueller drain was formed within the central left hepatic duct. Contrast was injected to confirm tube position. The catheter was secured to the skin with 2-0 Ethilon. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.  The procedure was well tolerated, and the patient discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 40 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 11.5 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  140 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 40 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 0.5 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: Rocephin, 2 g IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Findings:   1.\tThe existing tube is dislodged   2.\tThe new tube is appropriately positioned within in the stomach.  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful replacement of 18 French MIC gastrostomy tube.      Treatment Plan:   It is OK to use the tube immediately.  Routine check and change recommended in 6 months.  Technique:   Informed consent for the procedure was obtained, and time-out was performed prior to the procedure.  The skin overlying the access site was subsequently prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines). The skin and subcutaneous tissue around the existing tube were infiltrated with local anesthetic. A scout image was obtained of the abdomen.  The existing tube was removed. Using a Kumpe catheter a wire was advanced into the gastric lumen. The catheter was removed over the wire and a new gastrostomy tube was advanced over the wire. The replacement tube overlies the stomach on static fluoroscopic image saved to PACS.  The balloon was inflated with 10 mL of a 10% contrast mixture. Gentle hand injection of contrast material documents the gastric feeding tube within the gastric lumen.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 40 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 1.3 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  41 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 0 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 0 mg IV. Fentanyl 0 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Findings:   1.\tThe gastrostomy tube is in good position.  2.\tGentle hand injection of contrast material confirms positioning of the gastrostomy tube within the gastric lumen.  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful placement of 18 French MIC gastrostomy tube as above.  Treatment Plan:   The tube should be placed to gravity drainage and should not be used for 24 hours. 25 cc of water can be administered per hour. At 4 hours, if residuals are less than 30%, the patient can have tube feeds advanced starting at a half dose.   Technique:   Informed consent for the procedure was obtained, and time-out was performed prior to the procedure.  The skin overlying the access site was subsequently prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the mid abdomen were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.   Using fluoroscopic and ultrasonographic guidance, an appropriate puncture site was identified.  3 T-fasteners were placed adjacent to the planned tube access site. Positioning of the T-fasteners within the gastric lumen was confirmed by return of air and direct injection of contrast material.  Next, under fluoroscopic guidance, an 18-gauge needle was directed into the gastric lumen. Needle positioning within the gastric lumen was confirmed with aspiration of air as well as gentle hand injection of contrast material.  A wire was advance through the 18-gauge needle.  The 18-gauge needle was removed over a wire. Dilation was accomplished over the stiff wire using an 8mm by 4 cm balloon. An 18 French Halyard G-tube was advanced over a wire in an antegrade fashion after deflating the balloon and advanced through the anterior abdominal wall. All wires and catheters were removed. The bulb was inflated with 10 mL of a 10% contrast mixture. Gentle hand injection of contrast material documents the gastric feeding tube within the gastric lumen. Static fluoroscopic image was obtained for reference purposes. The tube was flushed with saline. It was affixed to the anterior abdominal wall with a rubber flange. The patient tolerated the procedure well at time of procedure completion without complication.        Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Will Lindquester Fellow(s): Dr. Ross Bittman Resident(s): Alexandra Eckert, M.D. Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 40 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 4.5 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  49.9 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed. See anesthesia documentation for further details  Medications: Please see anesthesia documentation  Antibiotics: 3 g of Ancef  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Will Lindquester, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

The catheter tip terminates at the proximal right atrium .     Impression:   1.\tUneventful fluoroscopy guided placement of 5 French, 38 cm double-lumen PICC in the left upper extremity as described. The lumens flush and aspirate appropriately.   Removal of left upper extremity midline  Treatment Plan:   Catheter tip position is confirmed as above. It is OK to use this line.    Technique:   The site was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).   Scout image stored to PACS. The sutures for the left upper extremity midline was removed. A 0.018 wire was passed through the midline catheter more centrally. Following this, the dilator peel-away combination was placed. A 5 French dual lumen power PICC was cut to 38 cm and advanced centrally so that the tip of the catheter within the proximal right atrium  The peel-away was removed, and hemostasis achieved with manual compression. The catheter was aspirated, flushed, and locked per protocol. It was secured in place with 2-0 Prolene.  An antimicrobial disc and sterile dressing were applied.  The procedure was well tolerated, and the patient discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.

    "text": "Patient's Name: [PATIENT] MRN: [ID] Procedure date: [DATE] 3:15 PM  IR TUNNELED LARGE BORE CVC  Indications: Acute renal failure in need for hemodialysis.  Request is made for conversion of the non tunneled to tunneled dialysis catheter. The patient presents with an indwelling right  internal jugular vein non tunneled catheter without complications at the entry site.   Procedure: After explaining the technique, risks, benefits, alternatives, and answering all questions, informed consent was obtained from the patient. Timeout identifying the correct patient, procedure, site, allergies was performed and observed by the operating team. The patient was positioned supine. The procedure is performed under continuous physiologic monitoring. The patient received intravenous conscious sedation using Versed and fentanyl.  The right   side of the lower neck and upper chest including the indwelling 13  F Trialysis  catheter was prepped with chlorhexidine followed by Betadine and draped in a sterile fashion. No evidence of inflammation/infection at the entry site of the catheter is noted.   Following administration of local anesthesia using lidocaine 2% with epinephrine  10  ml at the right   side of the root of the neck extending to the right  infraclavicular region, 0.035\" guidewire was advanced through the existing catheter under fluoroscopy into the SVC. Through skin stab incision in the right  infraclavicular region, a 15 F x 19  cm [tip to cuff] dialysis catheter was tunneled exiting at the root of the neck  at the exit of the non tunneled catheter. A peel-away sheath was advanced under fluoroscopy over the guidewire under fluoroscopy following intact removal of the non tunneled catheter [13 F x 15  cm]. Following removal of the guidewire and inner dilator, the catheter was advanced into the SVC and buried in the subcutaneous tissues following peeling of the sheath. Hemostasis was secured. The catheter tip was adjusted at the level of the SVC/upper right atrium. Both ports demonstrated easy aspiration and injection and were flushed with hep saline per protocol. The incision at the root of the neck was closed with Dermabond. The catheter was anchored to the skin using Ethilon 2/0 interrupted skin stitches. Sterile occlusive dressing was applied at the exit of the catheter in infraclavicular region. The patient tolerated to the procedure well. There were no intraprocedural complications. The patient was transferred to recovery in stable condition and eventually to the floor. The catheter is ready to use. Please also refer to the Procedure note placed in the patient's EPIC chart on the date of the procedure.  Fluoroscopy time: 00:10.6 min.  Device implanted: Duraflow 15F x 24 cm, Lot.#5807192, cat. #10301201.   Recommendations: The patient will need routine catheter check and possible exchange every 3 months.  Fellows: None. Residents: None.  IMPRESSION: 1. Uneventful image guided right   internal jugular  vein tunneled dialysis catheter placement following removal of the non tunneled catheter. The catheter is ready to use.  Voice recognition is used in generating this report.",

A nephroureteral catheter was placed on [DATE]. The patient comes for conversion back to a nephrostomy tube.   Findings: Comparison is made to a previous exam dated [DATE].  1. Scout radiograph shows a right nephroureteral catheter with both cope loops in their expected location. 2. Contrast injection and wire passage confirmed occlusion of the distal 10 cm of the nephroureteral catheter. 3. The drain was severely encrusted. 4. With great difficulty, the catheter was removed intact. 5. Catheter injection once the catheter was retracted into the mid ureter showed irregularity of the entire ureter but prompt drainage to the bladder. 6. An 8.5 French nephrostomy tube has its cope loop in the renal pelvis.  Impression:   Difficult but successful image-guided conversion of a severely encrusted right nephroureteral catheter to an 8.5 French nephrostomy tube as described above.  Plan:  Flush catheter b.i.d.  Routine change in 8-10 week. The crystals and encrusted catheter was sent to the lab for stone analysis.  Technique:  The existing catheter and surrounding soft tissues were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  A scout radiograph was obtained.   Right nephroureteral tube PCN conversion:  Non-ionic contrast was injected through the existing right nephroureteral catheter and images of the collecting system obtained.  A 0.035” glide wire was advanced through the existing right nephroureteral catheter. The wire could not be negotiated out the end of the catheter. It did come out a sidehole and was easily advanced and looped in the bladder. With resistance, the distal cope loop was unformed old at the UVJ.  Attempt at placing a long 9 French peel-away sheath was unsuccessful as the peel-away buckled in the soft tissues. It did, however, disrupt the mature tract.  Substantial traction was needed to remove the encrusted catheter. Once the wire had been delivered at the skin, attempts were made to remove particulate in the distal portion of the catheter; however, the catheter could not be cleared. Ultimately, the PCNU was removed intact. The occluded catheter and crystals were sent to the lab for analysis.  A new 8.5 F nephrostomy catheter was advanced over the wire and the Cope loop formed in the renal pelvis.  Contrast injection confirmed location. The catheter was sutured to the flank with Ethilon and attached to gravity drainage. A sterile dressing was applied.  The procedure was well tolerated, and patient discharged from the angio suite in satisfactory condition.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Gail Peters Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 30 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 6.3 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  43.26 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 90 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 4 mg IV. Fentanyl 300 mcg IV. 2.25 mg IV Dilaudid  Antibiotics: 2 g IV Rocephin  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Procedure:  Ultrasound guided placement of a 10.2 French right nephrostomy tube Antegrade pyelography    FINDINGS: CT from [DATE] was reviewed  1. There is moderate pelvicalyceal dilatation by ultrasound.  Hydronephrosis and needle entry images were stored to PACS. 2. Urine returned was grossly purulent. A sample was sent. 3. A posterior interpolar calyx was accessed. 4. The nephrostomy Cope loop is in the renal pelvis.  IMPRESSION:  Uneventful right nephrostomy tube placement via a posterior  interpolar calyx utilizing ultrasound guidance.  TREATMENT PLANNING:  The tube should be placed to gravity.  After several weeks to drainage, an attempt at internalization to a nephroureteral catheter could be performed to make the tube more stable.  TECHNIQUE:  The right flank was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Ultrasonographic evaluation was carried out. A moderately dilated pelvicalyceal system was identified.  Under ultrasound guidance, a 22-gauge Chiba needle was advanced into the posterior calyx. No urine returned.  A 0.018\" wire was placed. The needle was exchanged for a transitional dilator. Purulent urine returned through the dilator. A sample was sent for analysis.  A 0.035\" Glidewire and 4 French angled catheter were used in attempt to traverse the high-grade UPJ obstruction. In light of purulent drainage, the decision was made to place a nephrostomy tube. An 035 wire as placed into the renal pelvis.  A an 0.2 French nephrostomy tube was advanced over the wire and the Cope loop formed and locked in the renal pelvis. A total of 45 mL frankly purulent material was aspirated from the renal pelvis. The catheter was injected. It was sutured to the skin with 2-0 Ethilon and attached to gravity drainage. A sterile dressing was applied.  The procedure was well-tolerated, and the patient was discharged still asleep into the care of anesthesiology for transfer to the PACU.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 20 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 4.7 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  61 mGy  Conscious Sedation: The procedure was performed under general anesthesia.  Antibiotics: 2 g IV Rocephin  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided exchange of non-tunneled for tunneled 16 French 23 cm cuff to tip right internal jugular hemodialysis catheter.   Treatment Plan:   Routine catheter care.  The catheter is ready for immediate use.     Technique:   The skin overlying the right neck and chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).    An Amplatz guidewire was placed through the existing non-tunneled right internal jugular hemodialysis catheter. Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site. The non-tunneled right internal jugular hemodialysis catheter was removed.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW]  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL   Fluoroscopy time: 0.3 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  8.29 mGy  Sedation:  None  Medications: Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.   Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

    "text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Male Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL].[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  Cirrhosis c/b HCC s/p resection c/b recurrence at margin now s/p   PROCEDURE:  Y90 Shunt study/mapping using MAA  1. US-guided left radial artery access. 2. Diagnostic visceral angiography 3. MAA delivery Cone-beam CT performed for intraprocedural localization, as detailed below.  FINDINGS: ANGIOGRAPHY: Vessels catheterized and angiograms performed, as follows:  Superior mesenteric artery: No replaced or accessory hepatic arterial supply. Celiac artery: Tumoral blush identified. Right hepatic artery: Tumoral blush identified. Segment IV  hepatic artery: Tumoral blush identified.  Specific technical notes / catheter selection: None.  CBCT: Yes Catheter location: Right hepatic artery Findings: Tumoral blush identified with supply from the target vessel.  Embolization: No Vessel embolized: N/a Coils used: N/a  MAA delivery performed from: Right hepatic artery (series 16 and 21  Future target Y90 delivery catheter position(s): right_ artery (Series 9 image 10), also suspect supply from phrenic and/or left gastric  Treatment device: cTACE Additional details:      IMPRESSION:   Successful Yttrium-90     selective internal radiotherapy mapping. Flow in vessels supplying tumor is easily overwhelmed with contrast injection. Also suspect extrahepatic supply.  TREATMENT PLAN:  1. Patient will return in 2-4 weeks for cTACE. Will utilize antireflux/balloon catheter to deliver therapy.  2. Access site precautions and orders placed.  TECHNIQUE:  With the patient in the supine position, the left wrist was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. The left wrist was evaluated with ultrasound and left radial artery patency and acceptable size criteria were documented and images were properly stored in PACS. A modified Allen test (Barbeau test Type B) was performed on the left wrist to confirm patency of the ulnopalmar arch using pulse oximetry.   1% lidocaine solution was administered for local anesthesia. Access was obtained to the left radial artery using a 21 gauge micro needle and ultrasound guidance. Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. Permanent recording and reporting of the saved image and study into the PACS system was performed. A wire was placed through the needle. A hydrophilic Glidesheath was advanced slowly over the wire. 3000 units of heparin, 200 mcg of nitroglycerin and 2.5 mg of verapamil was given through the arterial sheath with slow hemodilution. A side flush was started.   A 5-Fr Jacky/Sarah catheter was advanced over an 0.035\" wire into the abdominal aorta. The catheter was used to catheterize the visceral vessels described below. Angiograms were performed. A microcatheter system was used to catheterize distal visceral and hepatic vessels, as described below. Specific vessels catheterized and embolized are described in detail below. Tumor blush was confirmed on angiography.  Cone Beam CT (CBCT) was performed intraprocedurally for purposes of treatment planning, targeting and dose calculation. Axial and coronal images were created and 3D reconstruction was performed on a separate dedicated workstation under concurrent supervision.  After confirmation of target treatment vessel, 5 mCi of Tc-99 MAA was injected slowly in this location though the catheter.   All catheters and wires were removed from the patient. A TR Band was placed on the left wrist for hemostasis. The access sheath was removed and no hematoma was seen. A radial artery pulse was confirmed distal to the puncture site confirming patent hemostasis.   The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition without any immediate postprocedural complications. The patient was transferred to the Nuclear Medicine department for imaging.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Meghan Lilly Fellow(s):     Resident(s):     Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 150 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 9.2 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  1000 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 60 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Request is made for placement of an infusion port and removal of the PICC. The patient reported no current problems including infection, inflammation or swelling related to the left arm PICC.  Procedure: After explaining the technique, risks, benefits, alternatives, and answering all questions, informed consent was obtained from the patient. Timeout identifying the correct patient, procedure, site, allergies was performed and observed by the operating team. The patient was positioned supine with the head turned to the left. The procedure is performed under continuous physiologic monitoring. The patient received intravenous conscious sedation using Versed 2 mg and fentanyl 100 mcg.  Also the patient received Ancef 2 g IV.  The right side of the lower neck and upper chest was prepped with Betadine followed by chlorhexidine and draped in a sterile fashion.  Following administration of local anesthesia using lidocaine 1% with epinephrine 6ml at the right  side of the root of the neck, under ultrasound  guidance, access was obtained into the right  internal jugular vein using a micropuncture device. A 0.018\" guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the vein centrally. Further administration of local anesthesia using lidocaine 1% with epinephrine 8 mL into the right  infraclavicular region. A transverse 3.5  cm incision was performed and a pocket created inferior to the incision to accommodate the port using both sharp and blunt dissection. Through the infraclavicular incision, the port tubing 8 F was tunneled exiting at the root of the neck following a nick incision at the exit of the guidewire. The guidewire was upgraded to 0.035\" guidewire that was advanced under fluoroscopy through the SVC into the IVC. A peel-away sheath was advanced over the guidewire. Following removal of the guidewire and the stiffener, the port tubing was advanced after trimming to a length of 18 cm. The sheath was peeled away and the line was buried in the subcutaneous tissues. The tip of the line is at the SVC/upper right atrium. The port was tested demonstrating easy aspiration and injection and was flushed with normal saline followed by hep saline as per protocol. The port was anchored in the subcutaneous tissues using nonabsorbable 2/0 interrupted stitches. The wound was irrigated. Hemostasis secured. The incision at the root of the neck was closed using Dermabond. The infraclavicular incision was closed using subcutaneous followed by subcuticular Vicryl 4/0 continuous stitches. Steri-Strips were applied followed by Sterile occlusive dressing. The patient tolerated to the procedure well. There were no intraprocedural complications.   The left arm was abducted and resting on an arm board. Initial assessment did not reveal any inflammation, infection or discharge at the exit site of the 5F double lumen PICC. The left arm was prepped with chlorhexidine and draped in sterile fashion. The PICC was removed intact with the length of 40 cm. Sterile dry occlusive dressing was applied. The patient was transferred to recovery in stable condition and eventually discharged. The port is ready to use. Please also refer to the Procedure note placed in the patient's EPIC chart on the date of the procedure.  Fluoroscopy time: 00:33.6 min.  Device implanted: 8F single lumen power port, Ref #5608062, Lot #REHW1854.  Fellows: None. Residents: None.  IMPRESSION: 1. Uneventful ultrasound fluoroscopy guided placement of 8F Power  infusion port in the right  internal jugular vein. The port is ready to use. 2. Uneventful removal of the left arm PICC.

    "text": "Patient's Name: [PATIENT]  MRN: [ID] [DATE] 10:05 AM   *\tIR CENTRAL PORT, IR PERIPHERAL PICC placement *\tLeft arm PICC removal  Indications: The patient presents with mental cell lymphoma and is currently on IV chemotherapy via a left arm PICC.  Request is made for placement of an infusion port and removal of the PICC. The patient reported no current problems including infection, inflammation or swelling related to the left arm PICC.  Procedure: After explaining the technique, risks, benefits, alternatives, and answering all questions, informed consent was obtained from the patient. Timeout identifying the correct patient, procedure, site, allergies was performed and observed by the operating team. The patient was positioned supine with the head turned to the left. The procedure is performed under continuous physiologic monitoring. The patient received intravenous conscious sedation using Versed 2 mg and fentanyl 100 mcg.  Also the patient received Ancef 2 g IV.  The right side of the lower neck and upper chest was prepped with Betadine followed by chlorhexidine and draped in a sterile fashion.  Following administration of local anesthesia using lidocaine 1% with epinephrine 6ml at the right  side of the root of the neck, under ultrasound  guidance, access was obtained into the right  internal jugular vein using a micropuncture device. A 0.018\" guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the vein centrally. Further administration of local anesthesia using lidocaine 1% with epinephrine 8 mL into the right  infraclavicular region. A transverse 3.5  cm incision was performed and a pocket created inferior to the incision to accommodate the port using both sharp and blunt dissection. Through the infraclavicular incision, the port tubing 8 F was tunneled exiting at the root of the neck following a nick incision at the exit of the guidewire. The guidewire was upgraded to 0.035\" guidewire that was advanced under fluoroscopy through the SVC into the IVC. A peel-away sheath was advanced over the guidewire. Following removal of the guidewire and the stiffener, the port tubing was advanced after trimming to a length of 18 cm. The sheath was peeled away and the line was buried in the subcutaneous tissues. The tip of the line is at the SVC/upper right atrium. The port was tested demonstrating easy aspiration and injection and was flushed with normal saline followed by hep saline as per protocol. The port was anchored in the subcutaneous tissues using nonabsorbable 2/0 interrupted stitches. The wound was irrigated. Hemostasis secured. The incision at the root of the neck was closed using Dermabond. The infraclavicular incision was closed using subcutaneous followed by subcuticular Vicryl 4/0 continuous stitches. Steri-Strips were applied followed by Sterile occlusive dressing. The patient tolerated to the procedure well. There were no intraprocedural complications.   The left arm was abducted and resting on an arm board. Initial assessment did not reveal any inflammation, infection or discharge at the exit site of the 5F double lumen PICC. The left arm was prepped with chlorhexidine and draped in sterile fashion. The PICC was removed intact with the length of 40 cm. Sterile dry occlusive dressing was applied. The patient was transferred to recovery in stable condition and eventually discharged. The port is ready to use. Please also refer to the Procedure note placed in the patient's EPIC chart on the date of the procedure.  Fluoroscopy time: 00:33.6 min.  Device implanted: 8F single lumen power port, Ref #5608062, Lot #REHW1854.  Fellows: None. Residents: None.  IMPRESSION: 1. Uneventful ultrasound fluoroscopy guided placement of 8F Power  infusion port in the right  internal jugular vein. The port is ready to use. 2. Uneventful removal of the left arm PICC.  Voice recognition is used in generating this report.",

Procedure:   1.\tDouble lumen PICC placement using ultrasound and fluoroscopy      Findings:   1.  Vein patency was documented by ultrasound and stored to PACS. 2.  The catheter tip terminates near the cavoatrial junction.        Impression:   1.\tUneventful image guided placement of 5 French, 45 cm double-lumen PICC in the right upper extremity as described. The lumens flush and aspirate appropriately.        Treatment Plan:   Catheter tip position is confirmed as above. It is OK to use this line.       Technique:   The site was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).   Ultrasound evaluation of the right basilic vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS. Local anesthetic was used over the access site. Under ultrasound guidance, the right basilic vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS.    A 0.018\" wire was passed centrally and the needle exchanged for a dilator peel-away combination. The wire was used to determine catheter length, and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line cut to appropriate length. The tailored catheter was advanced through the peel-away and positioned centrally using fluoroscopy.   The peel-away was removed, and hemostasis achieved with manual compression. The catheter was aspirated, flushed, and locked per protocol. It was secured in place with 2-0 Prolene suture.  An antimicrobial disc and sterile dressing were applied.  The procedure was well tolerated, and the patient discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.        Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s): [HCW] Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: None   Fluoroscopy time: 0.3 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  0.66 mGy  Conscious Sedation: Local anesthesia.  Medications: Fentanyl 25 mcg IV (corresponding to the patient's standing inpatient dose)   Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Tina Sankhla, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

    "text": "Patient's Name: [PATIENT]  MRN: [ID] [DATE] 10:25 AM   IR CENTRAL PORT  Indications: Right breast cancer planned to start IV chemotherapy.  Request is made for an infusion port placement.  Procedure: After explaining the technique, risks, benefits, alternatives, and answering all questions, informed consent was obtained from the patient. Timeout identifying the correct patient, procedure, site, allergies was performed and observed by the operating team. The patient was positioned supine with the head turned to the left. The procedure is performed under continuous physiologic monitoring. The patient received intravenous conscious sedation using Versed 3 mg and fentanyl 150 mcg.  Also the patient received Ancef 2 g IV.  The left side of the lower neck and upper chest was prepped with Betadine followed by chlorhexidine and draped in a sterile fashion.  Following administration of local anesthesia using lidocaine 1% with epinephrine 6ml at the left side of the root of the neck, under ultrasound  guidance, access was obtained into the left internal jugular vein using a micropuncture device. A 0.018\" guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the vein centrally. Further administration of local anesthesia using lidocaine 1% with epinephrine 8 mL into the left infraclavicular region. A transverse 3.5  cm incision was performed and a pocket created inferior to the incision to accommodate the port using both sharp and blunt dissection. Through the infraclavicular incision, the port tubing 8 F was tunneled exiting at the root of the neck following a nick incision at the exit of the guidewire. The guidewire was upgraded to 0.035\" guidewire that was advanced under fluoroscopy through the SVC into the IVC. A peel-away sheath was advanced over the guidewire. Following removal of the guidewire and the stiffener, the port tubing was advanced after trimming to a length of 24 cm. The sheath was peeled away and the line was buried in the subcutaneous tissues. The tip of the line is at the SVC/upper right atrium. The port was tested demonstrating easy aspiration and injection and was flushed with normal saline followed by hep saline as per protocol. The port was anchored in the subcutaneous tissues using nonabsorbable 2/0 interrupted stitches. The wound was irrigated. Hemostasis secured. The incision at the root of the neck was closed using Dermabond. The infraclavicular incision was closed using subcutaneous followed by subcuticular Vicryl 3/0 continuous stitches. Steri-Strips were applied followed by Sterile occlusive dressing. The patient tolerated to the procedure well. There were no intraprocedural complications. The patient was transferred to recovery in stable condition and eventually discharged. The port is ready to use. Please also refer to the Procedure note placed in the patient's EPIC chart on the date of the procedure.  Fluoroscopy time: 00:19.5 min.  Device implanted: 8F single lumen power port, LOT #REHW1854, REF #5608062.  Fellows: None. Residents: None.  IMPRESSION: 1. Uneventful ultrasound fluoroscopy guided placement of 8F Power  infusion port in the left internal jugular vein. The port is ready to use.  Voice recognition is used in generating this report.",

    "text": "DIAGNOSTIC CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM  CLINICAL INDICATION: This is a 67 years Female who presents for diagnostic cerebral angiography following incidental finding of anterior communicating artery aneurysm   PROCEDURE: Diagnostic cerebral angiogram.  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 30 minutes.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] was the fellow. Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right Internal Carotid Artery Right External Carotid Artery Left Common Carotid Artery Left Subclavian Artery   ANESTHESIA: Local in the right groin with bupivacaine. Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by the nurse present during the entire procedure. The patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Sedation was administered by a specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for the duration of the procedure as outlined above (Total intra service time, 30min ). Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.   MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Versed 1 mg IV Fentanyl 50 mcg IV Heparin 3000 units IV Protamine 20 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter  5 French Simmons 3 Glide catheter  Cardiva Vascade Visipaque-270 contrast material (120 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the right internal carotid artery for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Vascade followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Noninvasive imaging.  FINDINGS:  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a 4.6 x 4.8 x 4.1 mm medially directed anterior communicating artery aneurysm which fills predominantly from the right A1 segment of the ACA. The bilateral ACA branches fill from the right A1. The right internal carotid artery and its segments are normal course and caliber. The right posterior communicating artery is dominant supplies the posterior cerebral artery territory. The MCA and its branches are normal course and caliber. There is normal cortical venous drainage.   RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Reflux of contrast into the contralateral vertebral artery was not achieved. The origin of PICA is normal unilaterally (we will defer to CTA for evaluation of the contralateral PICA). This run is limited by the distal location of the catheter with poor contrast opacification.  LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a mildly hypoplastic left A1 segment of the ACA with brief visualization of the anterior communicating artery aneurysm. The left posterior communicating artery is dominant supplies the posterior cerebral territory. The segments of the left internal carotid artery are normal course and caliber. The MCA and its branches are normal course and caliber. There are normal cortical venous drainage  LEFT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.    3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated a medially directed anterior communicating artery aneurysm measuring 4.8 x 4.8 x 4.1 mm and is without irregular features. The bilateral ACA territories are visualized on this run.   COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: There is a medially directed 4.8 x 4.8 x 4.1 mm anterior communicating artery aneurysm filling predominantly from the right A1 segment of the ACA. The left A1 segment of the ACA is hypoplastic. No other aneurysms are identified.  Charles M Cawley, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

Procedure:   1.\tLeft nephrostogram and nephroureteral sheath placement      Findings:  Comparison is made to a previous exam dated [DATE].  1.\tScout shows large calculi in the left UPJ   2.\tMild hydronephrosis 3.\tSuccessful placement of 6Fr nephroureteral sheath  Catheter(s):  6 F Destination nephroureteral guiding sheath.  Impression:   1.\tUneventful ultrasound and fluroscopic-guided placement of a left nephroureteral sheath as described above.      Treatment Plan:   Sheath ready to be used immediately for planned percutaneous nephrolithotomy.  Technique:   The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure and sedation were explained to the patient. Written informed consent was obtained.  A time out/call to order was performed prior to procedure initiation.  The soft tissues overlying the access site were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Ultrasound was utilized to identify an appropriate access site. Static ultrasound image was obtained and stored to PACS for reference purposes. Subsequently, under fluoroscopic and real-time concurrent ultrasound guidance, access was obtained into a interpolar calyx using a 21 ga needle and a triaxial sheath system ([HCW]). Local anesthetic was injected at the catheter entry site. A wire was advanced centrally. The wire and inner dilator were removed. Non-ionic contrast was injected into the collecting system and images of the antegrade pyelogram were obtained and stored to PACS.  An 0.035” wire was advanced through the existing access and used to navigate into the distal ureter. A 6 F Destination nephroureteral sheath was advanced over the wire. Contrast injection confirmed location. The catheter was sutured to the flank with monofilament suture. A sterile dressing was applied.  The procedure was well tolerated, and patient discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.        Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW]. Tina Sankhla Fellow(s): None Resident(s): Dr. Ethan Leng Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 15 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 6.8 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  42.2 mGy  Sedation/Medications: Please refer to the anesthesia documentation.  Antibiotics: Rocephin, 2 g IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Tina Sankhla, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

Hickman catheter placed [DATE] now with catheter malfunction  Procedure:  1. Fluoroscopic guided exchange of tunneled Hickman catheter  Findings:  1. Scout image demonstrates existing right IJ tunneled Hickman with tip positioned in the right atrium. 2. Newly exchanged right IJ tunneled Hickman is appropriately positioned with the tip in the right atrium.   Impression:  Uneventful image guided wire exchange of a right IJ tunneled Hickman catheter.   Plan:  Catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:  The right chest wall and area immediately around the existing double lumen Hickman catheter was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier.  Using local anesthetic, the tract was anesthetized. Utilizing a hemostat, the tract was accessed and the cuff freed from the surrounding soft tissues. Two stiff angled glided wires was advanced through each lumen of the existing Hickman catheter and navigated down the IVC under direct fluoroscopic guidance. The catheter was then pulled with gentle traction until it was completely removed over the wire.  A new double lumen Hickman catheter was advanced over the wire until the tip was positioned appropriately and the cuff positioned within the tunnel. 2-0 Prolene suture was placed at the catheter tunnel exit site. Sterile dressing was applied.  The catheter was aspirated, flushed, and heparinized per protocol. The procedure was well tolerated, and the patient was discharged in satisfactory condition.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s): [HCW] Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: None  Fluoroscopy time: 0.4 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  0.61 mGy  Conscious Sedation: Sedation was provided via general anesthesia. For further details please refer to the anesthesia record.  Medications: For further details please refer to the anesthesia record.  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.

PROCEDURE: Diagnostic cerebral angiogram.  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 30 minutes.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] was the fellow. Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right Internal Carotid Artery Right External Carotid Artery Left Internal Carotid Artery Left External Carotid Artery Right Vertebral Artery   ANESTHESIA: Local in the right groin with bupivacaine. Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by the nurse present during the entire procedure. The patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Sedation was administered by a specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for the duration of the procedure as outlined above (Total intra service time, 30 ). Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.   MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Versed 1 mg IV Fentanyl 50 mcg IV Heparin 3000 units IV Protamine 20 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter  Cardiva Vascade Visipaque-270 contrast material (80 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.    Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by manual compression for 25 minutes.  COMPARISON: Noninvasive imaging.  FINDINGS:  RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Reflux of contrast into the contralateral vertebral artery was not achieved. The origin of PICA is normal unilaterally (we will defer to CTA for evaluation of the contralateral PICA).   RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. The right internal carotid artery and its segments are normal course and caliber. The ACA and MCA and its branches are normal course and caliber. There is filling of the bilateral ACA territories from the right A1 segment of the ACA. There is normal cortical venous drainage.   RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There are 2 distal ACA branches and one distal MCA branch with mild caliber irregularities. While this could represent vasculitis, this is more likely to be reactive changes to the nearby ICH given that these changes are not visualized elsewhere. The remaining branches of the ACA and MCA are normal course and caliber. There is normal cortical venous drainage.  LEFT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.    COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: Unremarkable diagnostic cerebral angiogram. There are mild vessel caliber irregularities in a couple distal branches of the ACA and MCA which are likely to represent reactive changes to the nearby left frontal ICH rather than an underlying inflammatory process.  Brian Howard, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

    "text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Female Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL]C.[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  Sepsis requiring long-term venous access for antibiotics.  Procedure:   1.\tTunneled central venous catheter placement     Findings:   1.\tThe right internal jugular vein is sonographically patent and compressible.  2.\tAfter placement of the tunneled catheter, as described, the tip terminates near the cavoatrial junction.  Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a power-injectable, 5 Fr, 21 cm, tunneled non-cuffed central venous catheter via the right internal jugular vein.       Treatment Plan:   Routine catheter care.  The catheter is ready for immediate use.      Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed below.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a peel-away sheath set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture peel-away sheath set, the wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.  Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.    Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Janice Newsome Dr. Will Lindquester Fellow(s):     Resident(s): Dr. Kimani Hicks Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.6 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  1 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 31 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 0.5 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.   Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Janice Newsome, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

An ultrasound image documenting vein patency was stored to PACS. 2.\tThe port catheter has a smooth course with the tip terminating near the cavoatrial junction.  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful placement of a tunneled right internal jugular 8 French single lumen Bard power Port-A-Cath using sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance.  Treatment Plan:   The catheter tip is in good position. The line flushes and aspirates appropriately.  The catheter is okay to use.  Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed above.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Subsequently, the right chest was anesthetized with lidocaine solution , both with and without epinephrine. An incision was made. A port pocket was created. The port reservoir was placed within the port pocket after adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The port was not affixed to the chest wall with suture.  The catheter was tunneled under the skin of the right  chest.   Under fluoroscopic guidance, a peel-away sheath was advanced through the venotomy site over a guide wire to the level of the right atrium. The catheter was inserted through the peel-away sheath and into the  internal jugular vein  via a peel-away sheath after removal of the dilator and wire. Static fluoroscopic image was obtained documenting the tip of the port catheter in good position near the cavoatrial junction. The port flushes and aspirates appropriately.   The port pocket was closed with buried, interrupted subcutaneous 2-0 absorbable sutures. A running 4-0 absorbable subcuticular stitch and  Dermabond was used to close the skin.  The access site was sealed with a single subcuticular stitch and Dermabond.   The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate post procedural complication.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): McMillan, Ian, PA-C Advanced practice provider(s): Luo, Yea-pyng, PA-C  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 1.7 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  18.9 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of     minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV  Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

    "text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Female Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL]C[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  Osteoporosis with painful compression fracture  Additional Clinical Indication: Spine MRI/bone-scan is within 30 days of this procedure and was performed on [DATE]. Patient has severe back pain despite optimal non-surgical management with severe impact of vertebral body compression fracture(s) on daily functioning. Patient has kyphotic deformity due to vertebral body compression fracture(s).     Procedure:   1.\tImage-guided kyphoplasty of L2 vertebral body  Findings:   1.\tPre-intervention: Previously treated T8-L1, L2 target  2.\tPost-intervention:  Successful deposition of cement within the treated vertebral body/bodies with no evidence of extravasation.    Impression:   1.\tSuccessful image guided augmentation of vertebral levels: L2    Treatment Plan:   1.\t A fracture of the hip, spine or distal radius in patients over 50 years of age warrants testing or treatment for osteoporosis if not previously undertaken.   Patient was instructed to take part in an osteoporosis prevention/treatment program.   Technique:   The patient was brought to the interventional radiology suite and placed on the table in prone position. The wide area of the back around the affected area(s) was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.   All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines). A scout image was obtained in AP and lateral projections.  Skin was anesthetized with a 2% lidocaine solution.   Level by level technique:   -Vertebral level:  L2     -Pedicle access:  Bipedicular -Access trocar gauge:  8-gauge -Balloon utilized:  15 mm  Prior to injection of cement, balloons were inserted and inflated under biplane fluoroscopy.  Static fluoroscopic images were stored to PACS documenting balloon utilization and position. -Biopsy obtained:  No -Indication for biopsy: N/A -Ablation Performed: N/A  Additional Procedural Details:   Utilizing AP and lateral fluoroscopy, needles were inserted into the affected vertebral body/bodies. Needles were advanced under careful, intermittent biplane fluoroscopy to ensure that the medial wall of the pedicle was not violated prior to transgression of the needle tip into the posterior wall of the vertebral body. The drill was then advanced to the anterior one-third of the vertebral body on each side.  No ablation was performed.  Balloon(s) was/were inserted into the effected vertebral body/bodies and inflated under fluoroscopy. Static fluoroscopic images were stored to PACS documenting balloon position. Cement was mixed and balloons were removed after being deflated.  Cement was then injected under careful, intermittent biplane fluoroscopy to ensure no significant extravasation of PMMA cement beyond the borders of the vertebral body. Cement injection was stopped once there was adequate fill of the vertebral body. Trochars were removed with hemostasis obtained with focal compression. Static fluoroscopic images were obtained after removal of all needles documenting final cement position.     Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Meghan Lilly Fellow(s):     Resident(s):     Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 9.5 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  1054 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 30 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications See anesthesia report   Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Impression:  1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a  15.5 French, 23 cm (tip-to-cuff), tunneled large bore central venous catheter via the right internal jugular vein.  Treatment Plan:  1. Routine catheter care. 2. The catheter is ready for immediate use.  Technique:  The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  The skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle. An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the dialysis catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of a peel-away sheath.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.

    "text": "CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM AND WOVEN ENDOBRIDGE (WEB) EMBOLIZATION OF BASILAR APEX ANEURYSM    CLINICAL INDICATION: 54-year-old female with past medical history of hypertension, sickle cell disease and multiple incidentally discovered intracranial aneurysms including a right M1 segment aneurysm, a right MCA bifurcation aneurysm, and a right SCA aneurysm for which she previously underwent right-sided orbitozygomatic craniotomy and clip ligation in [DATE]. She also has a basilar apex aneurysm which is indicated.   PROCEDURE: Cerebral angiogram, Woven Endobridge device embolization of basilar apex aneurysm.  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: 4 hours.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician.  He supervised the entire procedure. [HCW] and [HCW] were the fellows. Each actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS CATHETERIZED: Left vertebral artery Basilar artery  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right subclavian artery Right common femoral artery Left vertebral artery Left subclavian artery  VESSELS TREATED (in sequence): Basilar artery  ANESTHESIA:   General Anesthesia administered by anesthesiology staff.  Pre- Intra- and post- anesthesia records are available in the patient chart.   MEDICATIONS GIVEN:  Verapamil 2.5 mg intra-arterial into the right radial artery Nitroglycerin 200 mcg intra-arterial into the right radial artery Heparin 1000 units into the right radial artery Heparin 4000 units IV Ancef 2 gram IV  MATERIALS USED:  6 French Terumo slender sheath, long 5 French micropuncture kit Cope mandrel wire 5 French transitional dilator 6 French 65cm Arrow sheath 0.035\" Bentson guidewire 0.035\" Terumo glidewire (180 cm) 5 French Merit Performa Vertebral catheter 5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter 6 French Sofia guide catheter, 115 cm 5 French Sofia guide catheter, 115 cm  VIA 17 microcatheter (156 cm) Asahi 014 microguidewire (200 cm) Omnipaque 300 contrast material (180 cc) 6 French AngioSeal closure device  DEVICE IMPLANTED: Woven Endobridge SL 7 mm x 4 mm  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, hemorrhage, renal failure, limb loss, death, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.  After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion after intubation by the anesthesiology team.   Initial access to the vascular system was via the right radial artery. A right radial artery line and replaced by anesthesia staff. Through the pre-existing right radial catheter a guidewire was introduced and the radial artery line catheter was exchanged for a 6 French slender Terumo sheath. A radial cocktail consisting of 2.5 mg of verapamil, 200 mcg of nitroglycerin, and 1000 units of heparin was given slowly via the radial sheath. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the 5 French merit Performa vertebral catheter was advanced over the 150 cm baby J Glidewire. A roadmap angiogram of the right subclavian was performed. There is evident from this roadmap angiogram that the V2 segment of the right vertebral artery was significantly more tortuous than head appeared on the CT angiogram. Given this we decided to abandon the approach from the right vertebral artery and therefore the right radial approach in favor of a left vertebral artery approach via femoral access.  Access to the vascular system was gained by a single-wall puncture of the right common femoral artery. An angiogram of the right common femoral artery was performed through the outer cannula the dilator to confirm that the arteriotomy was an appropriate location in adequate for use of appropriate closure device. A 6 French 65cm Arrow sheath was introduced into the descending aortausing Seldinger technique and fluoroscopic guidance.  Using fluoroscopic guidance, the 5 French selection catheter was advanced through the arrow sheath to select the left subclavian artery and left vertebral artery.  The arrow sheath was then advanced over the selection catheter into the left subclavian artery. Digital angiogram was performed, centered over the head.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY: Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the proximal to mid V2 segment of the left vertebral artery for better delineation of the intracranial vasculature. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.  Following the diagnostic angiogram, the 5 French diagnostic catheter was withdrawn.  Through the long sheath, a 6 French Sofia guide catheter was advanced into the left vertebral artery over the VIA 17 microcatheter and Asahi 014 microguidewire. However we were unable to advance the microcatheter and microguidewire beyond the proximal V3 segment for the 072 Navien guide catheter beyond the mid to distal V2 segment due to the tortuosity of the V2 segment of the left vertebral artery. We therefore removed the 6 French Sofia guide catheter and the microcatheters. Were ultimately able to advance and 5 French Sofia guide catheter over a Terumo Glidewire into the proximal V3 segment of the left vertebral artery.   Superselective catheterization of the basilar artery aneurysm was then performed with the VIA 17 microcatheter over a Asahi 014 microguidewire. The WEB SL 7 mm x 4 mm device was then deployed inside of the aneurysm using roadmap and blank roadmap technique.   A final cerebral angiogram was done in the AP and lateral projection to evaluate for residual filling, and distal emboli.  Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine.  An angiogram of the right common femoral artery was obtained to confirm that the arterial puncture was above the bifurcation that the vessels of adequate size to use a 8 French AngioSeal. Ancef was administered.  Hemostasis was achieved by application of a 8 French AngioSeal. A Tegaderm was then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: None.  FINDINGS: RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CERVICAL (ROADMAP): This run was done primarily for navigation and selection of the right vertebral artery and is of limited diagnostic utility. Within those confines, there is severe tortuosity of the V2 segment of the right vertebral artery.  RIGHT COMMON FEMORAL ARTERY: The arteriotomy is above the bifurcation of the right common femoral artery and the diameter of the vessel is adequate for a 6 French AngioSeal.  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CERVICAL (ROADMAP): This run was done primarily for navigation and selection of the left vertebral artery and is of limited diagnostic utility. Within those confines, there is also severe tortuosity of the V2 segment of the right vertebral artery, albeit less than was visualized on the right. Additionally the caliber of the left vertebral artery is significantly larger than that of the right vertebral artery.  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a posteriorly projecting basilar apex aneurysm which is grossly unchanged from prior angiogram, the dimensions of which are described on the 3-D rotational angiography discussed below. There is a surgical clip seen in the expected location of the previously seen superior cerebellar artery aneurysm. No visualized recurrence or residual superior cerebellar artery aneurysm.  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-WOVEN ENDOBRIDGE DEVICE DEPLOYMENT): There is a Web device deployed within the basilar apex aneurysm. There is good apposition to the walls of the aneurysm, especially at the base, without evidence of endoleak. There is significant contrast stagnation within the dome of the aneurysm. The bilateral P1 segments appear patent and fill without delay. There are no perfusion deficits to suggest distal emboli in the posterior circulation.  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CERVICAL: No evidence of dissection post catheterization of the left vertebral artery.  LEFT SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY, CERVICOTHORACIC: No evidence of dissection or stenosis of the origin of the left vertebral artery post catheterization.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  3-D rotational angiography demonstrated posteriorly directed basilar apex aneurysm which measures 5.7 x 6.2 x 5.6 x 2.3 mm (axial by axial by neck-to-dome by neck) which is grossly stable in appearance compared to prior.    IMPRESSION: 1.\tSuccessful deployment of WEB device within unruptured basilar apex aneurysm with maintained patency of the bilateral PCAs. 2.\tNo evidence of recurrence or residual previously ligated superior cerebellar artery aneurysm",

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a tunneled Hickman catheter.       Treatment Plan:   Routine catheter care.  The catheter is ready for immediate use.        Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed above.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS.  A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 Amplatz wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance. An image was saved.  Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of a peel-away sheath.  The cut to length catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The catheter was tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.   The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Bryan Nicholas Swilley Fellow(s): Dr. Joseph Henain Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 1.3 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  5.2 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 60 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 2 mg IV. Fentanyl 100 mcg IV.  Antibiotics: Ancef, 1 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  Bryan N Swilley, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

Dislodged gastrostomy tube.  Procedure:   1.\tGastrostomy tube replacement under fluoroscopic guidance.  Findings:   1.\tThe existing tube is completely dislodged out of the stomach.   2.\tThe new tube is appropriately positioned within in the stomach.  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful replacement of 18 French MIC gastrostomy tube.      Treatment Plan:   It is OK to use the tube immediately.  Routine check and change recommended in 6 months.  Technique:   Informed consent for the procedure was obtained, and time-out was performed prior to the procedure.  The skin overlying the access site was subsequently prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines). The skin and subcutaneous tissue around the existing tube were infiltrated with local anesthetic. A scout image was obtained of the abdomen.  A 5 Fr Kumpe catheter was cannulated into the existing tube and passed into the gastric lumen. Contrast was injected to confirm the location. A stiff Glidewire was advanced into the stomach. An 18 Fr dilator was advanced over the wire to dilate the tract. Subsequently, a new gastrostomy tube was advanced over the wire. The replacement tube overlies the stomach on static fluoroscopic image saved to PACS.  The balloon was inflated with 10 mL of a 10% contrast mixture. Gentle hand injection of contrast material documents the gastric feeding tube within the gastric lumen.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s):     Resident(s):     Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 10 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 1.5 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  11.5 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 0 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: None  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  None  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Ultrasound and Fluoroscopic guided placement of a tunneled, cuffed central venous catheter  Findings:  1. The right internal jugular vein is ultrasonographically patent and normal. Vein patency and needle entry were stored to PACS. 2. The newly placed catheter has a smooth course with the tip terminating in the right atrium.  Impression:   Uneventful image guided placement of right internal jugular vein tunneled Trifusion catheter as described.  Technique:  The right neck and chest region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. The region was ultrasonographically evaluated.  Using local anesthetic and ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was punctured with a 21 gauge needle.  An image documenting vein patency and needle entry was saved and stored to PACS.   A 0.018” wire was passed centrally and the needle exchanged for a 5 French transitional dilator. A 0.035” wire was advanced through the dilator and negotiated into the IVC.  The skin tract was dilated and a 13 French dilator peel-away combination placed over the wire.  The soft tissues caudal and lateral to the sheath entry site were anesthetized with lidocaine with epinephrine. A dermatotomy was made and a tunneling tool brought from the dermatotomy to the venotomy. The catheter was brought through the tunnel.  During suspended respiration, the catheter was advanced through the peel-away and positioned centrally using fluoroscopy. The peel-away was removed and hemostasis achieved with manual compression.  The venotomy was closed with Dermabond and Steri-Strips applied. A single Prolene suture was placed at the catheter tunnel exit site. An antimicrobial disc and sterile dressing were applied.  The catheter was aspirated, flushed, and heparinized per protocol. The procedure was well tolerated, and the patient was discharged in satisfactory condition.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s):     Resident(s):     Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 2.0 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  11.17 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 30 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a power-injectable, 5 Fr, 19 cm, double-lumen tunneled non-cuffed central venous catheter via the right internal jugular vein.      Treatment Plan:   Routine catheter care.  The catheter is ready for immediate use.        Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).     The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a peel-away sheath set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture peel-away sheath set, the wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.  Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.          Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Kamil Arif Fellow(s): Dr. Ross Bittman Resident(s):     Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 1.9 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  0.7 mGy  Conscious Sedation: Not administered.  Medications: 8 mL subcutaneous 2% lidocaine infiltrated. No intravenous medication was given.  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Kamil Arif, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

Needs long-term IV antibiotics.  Procedure:   1.\tDouble lumen PICC placement using ultrasound and fluoroscopy .  Findings:   1.  Vein patency was documented by ultrasound and stored to PACS. 2.  The catheter tip terminates near the cavoatrial junction.        Impression:   1.\tUneventful image guided placement of 5 French, 53 cm double-lumen PICC in the right upper extremity as described. The lumens flush and aspirate appropriately.        Treatment Plan:   Catheter tip position is confirmed as above. It is OK to use this line.       Technique:   The site was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).   Ultrasound evaluation of the right basilic vein was performed, demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS. Local anesthetic was used over the access site. Under ultrasound guidance, the right basilic vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS.    A 0.018\" wire was passed however could not be advanced up the arm, concerning for proximal occlusion. The needle was removed.  Ultrasound evaluation of the brachial veins demonstrate patency. More local anesthetic was used over the new access site. Under ultrasound guidance the right brachial vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle. The 018 wire was then advanced centrally and the needle exchanged for a dilator peel-away combination. The wire was used to determine catheter length, and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line cut to appropriate length. The tailored catheter was advanced through the peel-away and positioned centrally using fluoroscopy.   The peel-away was removed, and hemostasis achieved with manual compression. The catheter was aspirated, flushed, and locked per protocol. It was secured in place with Ethilon.  An antimicrobial disc and sterile dressing were applied.  The procedure was well tolerated, and the patient discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s): [HCW] Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 3.8 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  10.3 mGy  Conscious Sedation: Not administered.   Medications: Local lidocaine.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  Peter Park, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a 14 French,  15 cm, non-tunneled large bore central venous catheter via the right internal jugular vein.  Treatment Plan:   Routine catheter care. The catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).        The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic. Ultrasound evaluation of the vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS. Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS.  A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, a 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of the catheter over the wire. The catheter was subsequently introduced over the wire and the wire removed. The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.  Procedural Personnel Advanced practice provider(s): [HCW]  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.8 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  5.74 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 0 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 0 mg IV. Fentanyl 0 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I Lindsay Greco, ACNP, performed the above procedure, Dr. Swilley was the attending of the day.",

Needs enteral nutrition access.  Procedure:   1.\tGastrostomy tube placement under fluoroscopic guidance.  Findings:   1.\tThe gastrostomy tube is in good position.  2.\tGentle hand injection of contrast material confirms positioning of the gastrostomy tube within the gastric lumen.  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful placement of 18 French MIC gastrostomy tube as above.  Treatment Plan:   The tube should be placed to gravity drainage and should not be used for 4 hours. 25 cc of water can be administered per hour. At 4 hours, if residuals are less than 30%, the patient can have tube feeds advanced starting at a half dose.   Technique:   Informed consent for the procedure was obtained, and time-out was performed prior to the procedure.  The skin overlying the access site was subsequently prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the mid abdomen were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.   Using ultrasound, the liver edges were demarcated. Under direct fluoroscopic guidance, an appropriate puncture site was identified.  3 T-fasteners were placed adjacent to the planned tube access site. Positioning of the T-fasteners within the gastric lumen was confirmed by return of air and direct injection of contrast material.  Next, under fluoroscopic guidance, an 18-gauge needle was directed into the gastric lumen. Needle positioning within the gastric lumen was confirmed with aspiration of air as well as gentle hand injection of contrast material.  A wire was advance through the 18-gauge needle.  The 18-gauge needle was removed over a wire. Serial dilation was accomplished over the stiff wire using the telescoping dilator. An 18 French Halyard G-tube was advanced over a wire in an antegrade fashion and advanced through the anterior abdominal wall. All wires and catheters were removed. The bulb was inflated with 10 mL of a sterile water. Gentle hand injection of contrast material documents the gastric feeding tube within the gastric lumen. Static fluoroscopic image was obtained for reference purposes. The tube was flushed with saline. It was affixed to the anterior abdominal wall with a rubber flange. The patient tolerated the procedure well at time of procedure completion without complication.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Bryan Nicholas Swilley Fellow(s): Dr. Joseph Henain Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 30 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 3.2 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  18.8 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Please see separate anesthesia documentation.  Medications: Please see separate anesthesia documentation.   Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  Bryan N Swilley, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

The hepatic artery occlusion with biliary cast syndrome. He has internal/external biliary drain replacement and bile ducts suite every 5 weeks. Here for routine maintenance.  Procedure:   1.\tCatheter cholangiogram through existing percutaneous access 2.\tFogarty balloon sweep of the bile duct 3.\tLeft internal/external biliary drain replacement  Findings:   1.\tCholangiogram through the existing 22 French Ben tech catheter demonstrates adequate filling of the bile duct and small bowel. 2.\tNewly placed biliary drain is appropriately positioned with the distal tip in the Roux limb and the proximal side hole in a peripheral bile duct with the radiopaque marker at midline along the spinous process.  Impression:   Uneventful image guided biliary Fogarty balloon sweep and replacement of 22 French internal/external mesenteric biliary catheter replacement.  Treatment Plan:   Routine exchange has been set up for 5 weeks.  Technique:   The existing catheter and surrounding soft tissues were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  A 0.035\" Amplatz was negotiated through the catheter into the small bowel.  The catheter was removed and a 5.5 French by 40 cm Fogarty was placed over the wire. The balloon was inflated in the bile duct and advanced over the Amplatz through the anastomosis twice. A new 22 French Bentec catheter was advanced over the glide and positioned fluoroscopically. Contrast was injected to confirm tube position. The tube was sutured in place and capped.     The catheter was secured to the skin with 2-0 Ethilon.  The procedure was well tolerated, and the patient discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s):     Resident(s):     Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 20 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 1.4 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  20.74 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 30 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 3 mg IV. Fentanyl 200 mcg IV. Benadryl 25 mg IV  Antibiotics: Rocephin, 2 g IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a  15.5 French, 23 cm (tip-to-cuff), tunneled large bore central venous catheter via the right internal jugular vein.  Treatment Plan:   1. Routine catheter care. 2. The catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed above.  The skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle. An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the dialysis catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of a peel-away sheath.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Tina Sankhla Advanced practice provider(s): Ian McMillan, PA-C  Complications: No immediate complications.  Fluoroscopy time: 1.7 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  16.05 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 30 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 0 mg IV. Fentanyl 25 mcg IV.   Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I Ian McMillan, PA, performed the above procedure under supervision of, Dr. Sankhla was the attending of the day.",

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a power-injectable, 5 Fr, 26 cm, tunneled non-cuffed central venous catheter via the right internal jugular vein.       Treatment Plan:   Routine catheter care.  The catheter is ready for immediate use.        Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).    The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a peel-away sheath set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture peel-away sheath set, the wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.  Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Judy W. Gichoya Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None  Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.4 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  2.34 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 30 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 0 mg IV. Fentanyl 25 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a  15.5 French, 23 cm (tip-to-cuff), tunneled large bore central venous catheter via the right internal jugular vein.  Treatment Plan:   1. Routine catheter care. 2. The catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed above.  The skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle. An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the dialysis catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of a peel-away sheath.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Tina Sankhla Advanced practice provider(s): Ian McMillan, PA-C  Complications: No immediate complications.  Fluoroscopy time: 0.9 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  2.91 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 30 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 0 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.   Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I Ian McMillan, PA, performed the above procedure under supervision of, Dr. Sankhla was the attending of the day.",

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a 14 French,  20 cm, non-tunneled large bore central venous catheter via the right internal jugular vein.  Treatment Plan:   Routine catheter care. The catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Local anesthesia used for this procedure   The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic. Ultrasound evaluation of the vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS. Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS.  A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, a 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of the catheter over the wire. The catheter was subsequently introduced over the wire and the wire removed. The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): None Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): [HCW]  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.9 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  5.91 mGy  Local anesthesia was used for this procedure.  Medications: Versed 0 mg IV. Fentanyl 0 mcg IV.  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I Hee Kang PA-C, performed the above procedure, Dr. Brandon Lei was the attending of the day.  The attending radiologist, Brandon Lei, MD, was available for procedural supervision and interpreted the images.",

An ultrasound image documenting vein patency was stored to PACS. 2.\tThe port catheter has a smooth course with the tip terminating near the cavoatrial junction.  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful placement of a tunneled right internal jugular 8 French single lumen Bard power Port-A-Cath using sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance.  Treatment Plan:   The catheter tip is in good position. The line flushes and aspirates appropriately.  The catheter is okay to use.  Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed above.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Subsequently, the right chest was anesthetized with lidocaine solution , both with and without epinephrine. An incision was made. A port pocket was created. The port reservoir was placed within the port pocket after adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The port was not affixed to the chest wall with suture.  The catheter was tunneled under the skin of the right  chest.   Under fluoroscopic guidance, a peel-away sheath was advanced through the venotomy site over a guide wire to the level of the right atrium. The catheter was inserted through the peel-away sheath and into the  internal jugular vein  via a peel-away sheath after removal of the dilator and wire. Static fluoroscopic image was obtained documenting the tip of the port catheter in good position near the cavoatrial junction. The port flushes and aspirates appropriately.   The port pocket was closed with buried, interrupted subcutaneous 2-0 absorbable sutures. A running 4-0 absorbable subcuticular stitch and  Dermabond was used to close the skin.  The access site was sealed with a single subcuticular stitch and Dermabond.   The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate post procedural complication.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Tina Sankhla Advanced practice provider(s): Ian McMillan, PA-C  Complications: No immediate complications.  Fluoroscopy time: 0.7 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  3.18 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 30 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.   Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I Ian McMillan, PA, performed the above procedure under supervision of, Dr. Sankhla was the attending of the day.",

Image-guided bone-marrow biopsy and aspiration 2. Cone-beam CT performed for intraprocedural localization, as detailed below.  Findings:   1. Cone-beam CT images through the pelvis demonstrate an appropriate target for  percutaneous biopsy device placement 2. Fluoroscopic images demonstrate appropriate placement of percutaneous biopsy device into the posterior iliac bone  Impression:   Successful image-guided bone marrow aspiration and marrow biopsy.   Treatment Plan:   1. Follow-up of pathology results  Technique:  Structure Name: Left posterior iliac crest Imaging: Cone-beam CT and fluoroscopy Introducer: Yes Biopsy Device: 11 gauge biopsy needle Sample size/number: 6+3 mL aspirate + core biopsy Cytology team: N/a  Cone Beam CT (CBCT) was performed intraprocedurally for purposes of treatment planning, targeting and dose calculation. Axial and coronal images were created and 3D reconstruction was performed on a separate dedicated workstation under concurrent supervision.  Using the above imaging of the pelvis, the posterior iliac crest was identified and marked. The skin overlying this site was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Local anesthesia was achieved using 2% lidocaine. A small skin incision was made with a scalpel. The bone marrow aspiration and biopsy was obtained from the posterior iliac crest using an introducer needle. Accuracy of specimen labeling with patient demographics was verified by two appropriately designated individuals.  The patient tolerated the procedure and was sent to the recovery area for monitoring.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): None Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): [HCW]  Complications: No immediate complications.  0.1 mins-FT, 170 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician/provider noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 30 minutes (Total intra service time). Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 0.5 mg IV. Fentanyl 0 mcg IV.   Antibiotics: none  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure. Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient. These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I Ian McMillan, PA, performed the above procedure under supervision of, Dr. Al-Khafaji was the attending of the day.",

An ultrasound image documenting vein patency was stored to PACS. 2.\tThe port catheter has a smooth course with the tip terminating near the cavoatrial junction.  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful placement of a tunneled right internal jugular 8 French single lumen Bard power Port-A-Cath using sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance.  Treatment Plan:   The catheter tip is in good position. The line flushes and aspirates appropriately.  The catheter is okay to use.  Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).   The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Subsequently, the right chest was anesthetized with lidocaine solution , both with and without epinephrine. An incision was made. A port pocket was created. The port reservoir was placed within the port pocket after adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The port was not affixed to the chest wall with suture.  The catheter was tunneled under the skin of the right  chest.   Under fluoroscopic guidance, a peel-away sheath was advanced through the venotomy site over a guide wire to the level of the right atrium. The catheter was inserted through the peel-away sheath and into the  internal jugular vein  via a peel-away sheath after removal of the dilator and wire. Static fluoroscopic image was obtained documenting the tip of the port catheter in good position near the cavoatrial junction. The port flushes and aspirates appropriately.   The port pocket was closed with buried, interrupted subcutaneous 2-0 absorbable sutures. A running 4-0 absorbable subcuticular stitch and  Dermabond was used to close the skin.  The access site was sealed with a single subcuticular stitch and Dermabond.   The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate post procedural complication.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Bryson Hauck Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): Patrick Francois, PA-C and Simon Jian, NP  Complications: No immediate complications.

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a  15.5 French, 23 cm (tip-to-cuff), tunneled large bore central venous catheter via the right internal jugular vein.  Treatment Plan:   1. Routine catheter care. 2. The catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed above.  The skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle. An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the dialysis catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of a peel-away sheath.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. J. David Prologo Advanced practice provider(s): Ian McMillan, PA-C  Complications: No immediate complications.  Fluoroscopy time: 4.4 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  2 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 30 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.   Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I Ian McMillan, PA, performed the above procedure under supervision of, Dr. Prologo was the attending of the day.",

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a 14 French,  20 cm, non-tunneled large bore central venous catheter via the right internal jugular vein.  Treatment Plan:   Routine catheter care. The catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Local anesthesia was used for this procedure   The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic. Ultrasound evaluation of the vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS. Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS.  A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, a 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of the catheter over the wire. The catheter was subsequently introduced over the wire and the wire removed. The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): None Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): [HCW]  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.4 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  3.19 mGy  Local anesthesia was used for this procedure.  Medications: Versed 0 mg IV. Fentanyl 0 mcg IV.  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I Hee Kang PA-C, performed the above procedure, Dr. Brandon Lei was the attending of the day.  The attending radiologist, Brandon Lei, MD, was available for procedural supervision and interpreted the images.",

Ultrasound and Fluoroscopic guided placement of a tunneled, cuffed central venous catheter  Findings:  1. The right internal jugular vein is ultrasonographically patent and normal. Vein patency and needle entry were stored to PACS. 2. The newly placed catheter has a smooth course with the tip terminating in the right atrium.  Impression:   Uneventful image guided placement of right internal jugular vein tunneled Trifusion catheter as described.  Technique:  The right neck and chest region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. The region was ultrasonographically evaluated.  Using local anesthetic and ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was punctured with a 21 gauge needle.  An image documenting vein patency and needle entry was saved and stored to PACS.   A 0.018” wire was passed centrally and the needle exchanged for a 5 French transitional dilator. A 0.035” wire was advanced through the dilator and negotiated into the IVC.  The skin tract was dilated and a 13 French dilator peel-away combination placed over the wire.  The soft tissues caudal and lateral to the sheath entry site were anesthetized with lidocaine with epinephrine. A dermatotomy was made and a tunneling tool brought from the dermatotomy to the venotomy. The catheter was brought through the tunnel.  During suspended respiration, the catheter was advanced through the peel-away and positioned centrally using fluoroscopy. The peel-away was removed and hemostasis achieved with manual compression.  The venotomy was closed with Dermabond and Steri-Strips applied. A single Prolene suture was placed at the catheter tunnel exit site. An antimicrobial disc and sterile dressing were applied.  The catheter was aspirated, flushed, and heparinized per protocol. The procedure was well tolerated, and the patient was discharged in satisfactory condition.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): None Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): [HCW]  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.4 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  2.85 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 30 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. Fentanyl 75 mcg IV.  Antibiotics: Ancef 2 g IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I Hee Kang PA-C, performed the above procedure, Dr. Brandon Lei was the attending of the day.  The attending radiologist, Brandon Lei, MD, was available for procedural supervision and interpreted the images.",

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated exchange of nontunneled dialysis catheter for new 15.5 French 23 cm tip to cuff tunneled dialysis catheter   Treatment Plan:   1. Routine catheter care. 2. The catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed below.  The skin and subcutaneous tissues surrounding the existing left IJ nontunneled dialysis catheter were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic. A 0.035 wire was placed through the Vas-Cath port and directed into the IVC under fluoroscopic guidance. The Vas-Cath was removed over the wire and replaced with a dilator. Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the dialysis catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of a peel-away sheath.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   At this point during the procedure the patient's oxygen saturation began to decrease into the 60s and 70s. A code met was called and patient was reversed using the Narcan. After reversal and treatment with nonrebreather patient's oxygen saturation returned to 98%. Patient was an alert and oriented moving extremities.  After the code met was called, the area was reprepped. The catheter was tested however neither port was able to be aspirated. Catheter was exchanged over the wire for a new catheter which functioned properly.  The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Tina Sankhla M.D. Fellow(s):     Resident(s):     Advanced practice provider(s): Eric Peterson, PA-C  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 1.7 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  5 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 45 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV. Narcan 0.4  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I Eric Peterson, PA-C did the above procedure. Dr. Sankhla was the attending of the day and was present",

An ultrasound image documenting vein patency was stored to PACS. 2.\tThe port catheter has a smooth course with the tip terminating near the cavoatrial junction.  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful placement of a tunneled left internal jugular 8 French single lumen Bard power Port-A-Cath using sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance.  Treatment Plan:   The catheter tip is in good position. The line flushes and aspirates appropriately.  The catheter is okay to use.  Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed below.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the left internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the left internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the left internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Subsequently, the left chest was anesthetized with lidocaine solution , both with and without epinephrine. An incision was made. A port pocket was created. The port reservoir was placed within the port pocket after adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The port was not affixed to the chest wall with suture.  The catheter was tunneled under the skin of the left chest.   Under fluoroscopic guidance, a peel-away sheath was advanced through the venotomy site over a guide wire to the level of the right atrium. The catheter was inserted through the peel-away sheath and into the  internal jugular vein  via a peel-away sheath after removal of the dilator and wire. Static fluoroscopic image was obtained documenting the tip of the port catheter in good position near the cavoatrial junction. The port flushes and aspirates appropriately.   The port pocket was closed with buried, interrupted subcutaneous 3-0 absorbable sutures.     Dermabond was used to close the skin.  The access site was sealed with     Dermabond.   The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate post procedural complication.   Procedural Personnel Advanced practice provider(s): Eric Peterson, PA-C  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 1.3 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  5.37 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 35 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I Eric Peterson, PA-C did the above procedure. Dr. Tina Sankhla was the attending of the day",

Patient with recurrent chylous leak. Prior lymphangiogram without thoracic duct leak, no embolization performed. Patient underwent thorascopic thoracic duct ligation, with persistent chylous leak.  PROCEDURE:   1. Lymphangiogram. 2. Accessory thoracic duct embolization. 3. Direct cisterna chyle leak embolization.   FINDINGS:  1. No thoracic duct opacification, in keeping with prior surgical ligation.  2. Access into an accessory thoracic duct, without evidence of leak. Successfully embolized with glue (1:1 glue:Lipiodol, 2 cc).  3. Direct access into leak originating at this cisterna chyle, successfully embolized with glue (1:2 glue:Lipiodol, 3 cc).  IMPRESSION:   Technically successful accessory thoracic duct and cisterna chyle glue embolization.  TREATMENT PLAN:  Monitor chest tube drain output, and follow-up with cardiothoracic surgery.   TECHNIQUE:  With the patient in the supine position, the bilateral groins and wide abdomen was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier.   A scout radiograph demonstrated lipiodol staining in the bilateral groins from prior lymphangiogram.  Ultrasound evaluation of bilateral groins demonstrated very few scant, normal-appearing lymph nodes. A small lymph node in the right groin was accessed using a 25-gauge spinal needle, and lipiodol was injected. Under fluoroscopic visualization, lipiodol was seen transiting up the iliac chain. Evaluation of the left groin without any appropriate lymph node target lipiodol injection.  A lymph node in the left iliac chain was then targeted under direct fluoroscopic guidance and accessed using a 21-gauge Chiba needle. More lipiodol was injected, and transitted up the iliac chain to the abdominal lymph nodes.  Intermittent fluoroscopy demonstrated transit of the lipiodol through the abdominal lymphatic network to cisterna chyle, however no lipiodol was seen transiting up into the chest. The cisterna chyle, was then directly accessed using a 21-gauge Chiba needle under fluoroscopic guidance. Lipiodol injection demonstrated mild lipiodol opacification and transit up into the chest however no dominant intrathoracic lymphatic duct or definite intrathoracic leak could be identified. A V18 wire was able to be navigated into an accessory thoracic duct into the chest. Cone beam CT confirmed positioning of the wire in this duct, without evidence of leak. The thoracic duct (known location from prior lymphangiogram), could not be identified, in keeping with the patient's known history of thoracic duct ligation.  Attention was then turned to the patient's neck, where we attempted to access the venolymphatic junction deep to the left internal jugular vein, however multiple attempts were unsuccessful, and these attempts were aborted.  We then reviewed the images obtained point extensively, that even before early injections of the cisterna chyle, lipiodol appeared to be leaking towards the right upper quadrant/right lower chest. Cone beam CT was then performed, and lipiodol was confirmed in the right pleural space, indicating that this truly was the site of leak.   The 21-gauge Chiba needle was then used to access a lymph node one vertebral body lower than the cisterna chyle, and glue was injected to this lymph node (with some retrograde flow noted down the abdominal lymphatic chain). The needle was then used to access the confirmed leak near its neck adjacent to the cisterna chyle. More glue was injected, under direct fluoroscopic evaluation, and lipiodol was seen within the chest tube.  At the end of the procedure all needles and wires were removed from the patient's body. The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition without any immediate postprocedural complications.

Findings:   1. Left internal jugular chest port with tip overlying the superior cavoatrial junction. 2. Port and catheter tubing appear intact. The catheter flushes and aspirates appropriately. 3. Digital subtraction angiogram demonstrates prompt flow of contrast from the catheter to the right atrium.   Impression:   Successful evaluation of the left internal jugular vein chest port.  The port catheter is patent.  The catheter flushes and aspirates appropriately.   Treatment Plan:   Patient was positioned supine on the table and using a one-inch Huber needle of the left tunneled port was accessed and flushed and aspirated with a 10 cc syringe with minimal effort.  Contrast was performed which failed to identify a fibrin sheath and the catheter. Catheter appear to be intact.  Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).    The port was accessed with a Huber needle. Contrast was injected through the needle into the port reservoir and port catheter. Digital subtraction angiograms were obtained under fluoroscopy. Images were reviewed and saved in PACS. The access needle was removed from the port. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate postprocedural complication.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Advanced practice provider(s): [HCW]  Complications: No immediate complications.

Here for routine exchange   Procedure:  1. Bilateral antegrade nephrostogram and percutaneous nephroureterostomy exchange.   Findings:  1. Right antegrade nephrostogram demonstrates flow of contrast into the urinary bladder.  2. Left antegrade nephrostogram demonstrates flow of contrast into the urinary bladder.  3. Newly placed PCNUs are appropriately positioned with the proximal loop in the renal pelvis and distal loop in the urinary bladder.  Impression:  Uneventful image-guided exchange of bilateral percutaneous nephroureterostomy tubes.   Plan:   Patient will be due for routine exchange in 10-12 weeks. Patient was extremely uncomfortable during the procedure and recommend future exchanges with mac anesthesia   Technique:  With the patient in prone position, the bilateral flanks were prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. A scout radiograph was obtained.   Right PCNU exchange   Contrast was injected through the existing nephrostomy/nephroureterostomy tube and imaging of the collecting was system performed. A 0.035\" wire was placed through the tube and the tube removed over the wire and discarded. A new, 8-French x 24 cm nephroureterostomy tube was advanced over the wire under fluoroscopic guidance. The wire was removed and the proximal loop formed and locked in the renal pelvis. Contrast injection confirmed location.  The catheter was sutured to the flank and placed to gravity drainage. A sterile dressing was applied.    Left PCNU exchange   Contrast was injected through the existing nephrostomy/nephroureterostomy tube and imaging of the collecting was system performed. A 0.035\" wire was placed through the tube and the tube removed over the wire and discarded. A new, 8-French x 24 cm nephroureterostomy tube was advanced over the wire under fluoroscopic guidance. The wire was removed and the proximal loop formed and locked in the renal pelvis. Contrast injection confirmed location.  The catheter was sutured to the flank and placed to gravity drainage. A sterile dressing was applied.    The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition without any immediate postprocedural complications.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW]y W. Gichoya Fellow(s): None  Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 20 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 4.4 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  10 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 60 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. Fentanyl 200 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Failed cystoscopic double-J ureteral stent placement  Procedure:   1. US guided calyceal access   2. Right antegrade pyelography  3. Right percutaneous nephroureteral catheter placement  Findings: Abdominal CT from [DATE] was reviewed  1. There is moderate to severe right hydroureteronephrosis with parenchymal thinning and obstruction in the distal ureter near the lower SI joint. 2. Hydronephrosis and needle entry images into the posterior interpolar calyx were stored to PACS. Urine returned was cloudy. 3. A urine sample was sent for analysis 4. The renal pelvis is bifid. 5. An 8.5 French by 28 cm nephroureteral catheter has its proximal cope loop in the lower pole moiety of the bifid renal pelvis and its distal cope loop in the urinary bladder.   Impression:   Uneventful image guided placement of an 8.5 French by 28 cm right nephroureteral catheter as described.  Treatment plan:  The patient will follow-up with urology. Follow-up catheter maintenance was scheduled for 8 weeks.   Technique:  Right:  1% lidocaine was used as local anesthetic. Under ultrasound guidance a 21-gauge micropuncture needle was introduced into the posterior interpolar calyx.  An 0.018\" wire was passed through the needle into the renal pelvis. The needle was removed and a 6 French coaxial dilator was placed over the wire.   Antegrade pyelography was performed.    A 4 French angled glide catheter and Glidewire were placed coaxially through the transitional dilator and access to the bladder achieved. Contrast injection confirmed location. An Amplatz wire was placed and coiled in the bladder.   The dilator was removed and an 8.5 French by 28 cm  nephroureteral catheter was advanced over the wire. The distal cope loop was formed in the urinary bladder and the proximal Cope loop  was formed within the renal pelvis.  The catheter was anchored to the skin utilizing 2-0 Ethilon and attached to gravity drainage. Later, in the ARU, the tube was capped at the request of the referring urologist.   The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite  still asleep discharged into the care of anesthesiology for transfer to the PACU.     Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Gail Peters Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 20 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 2.6 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  3 3 mGy  Conscious Sedation: The procedure was performed under general anesthesia with intubation.  Antibiotics: 2 g IV Rocephin  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a 14 French,  20 cm, non-tunneled large bore central venous catheter via the right internal jugular vein.  Treatment Plan:   Routine catheter care. The catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Local anesthesia was used for this procedure   The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic. Ultrasound evaluation of the vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS. Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS.  A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, a 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of the catheter over the wire. The catheter was subsequently introduced over the wire and the wire removed. The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): None Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): [HCW]  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.7 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  4.99 mGy  Local anesthesia was used for this procedure.  Medications: Versed 0 mg IV. Fentanyl 0 mcg IV.  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I Hee Kang PA-C, performed the above procedure, Dr. Brandon Lei was the attending of the day.  The attending radiologist, Brandon Lei, MD, was available for procedural supervision and interpreted the images.",

An ultrasound image documenting vein patency was stored to PACS. 2.\tThe port catheter has a smooth course with the tip terminating near the cavoatrial junction.  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful placement of a tunneled right internal jugular 8 French single lumen Medcomp power Port-A-Cath using sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance.  Treatment Plan:   The catheter tip is in good position. The line flushes and aspirates appropriately.  The catheter is okay to use.  Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed below.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Subsequently, the right chest was anesthetized with lidocaine solution , both with and without epinephrine. An incision was made. A port pocket was created. The port reservoir was placed within the port pocket after adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The port was not affixed to the chest wall with suture.  The catheter was tunneled under the skin of the right  chest.   Under fluoroscopic guidance, a peel-away sheath was advanced through the venotomy site over a guide wire to the level of the right atrium. The catheter was inserted through the peel-away sheath and into the  internal jugular vein  via a peel-away sheath after removal of the dilator and wire. Static fluoroscopic image was obtained documenting the tip of the port catheter in good position near the cavoatrial junction. The port flushes and aspirates appropriately.   The port pocket was closed with buried, interrupted subcutaneous 3-0 absorbable sutures. A running 4-0 absorbable subcuticular stitch and  Dermabond was used to close the skin.  The access site was sealed with     Dermabond.   The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate post procedural complication.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): None Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): Hilary Karp, PA-C  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.5 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  3 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 20 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 2 mg IV. Fentanyl 100 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I, Hilary Karp PA C. performed the procedure. Dr. J. Kim was the attending of record.",

The IVC is normal in caliber and without caval thrombus. Filter placed: Bard Denali Inferior vena cavogram post-deployment: Appropriate positioning below the renal veins without significant filter tilt. No evidence of thrombosis, perforation, or other complication.  Impression:   1.  Uneventful image guided placement of an infrarenal IVC filter.  Treatment Plan:  1. Patient will f/u in IR clinic for consultation for possible filter removal.  Technique:   The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure and sedation were explained.  The specific risks of bleeding, infection, pulmonary embolism, filter maldeployment, and filter migration were detailed and accepted. Written informed consent was obtained. The patient was assessed for conscious sedation and found to be an adequate candidate. A dedicated nurse monitored heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation throughout the procedure. Patient was brought to the procedure suite and a time out was performed prior to procedure initiation. The right neck was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.   The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the access site were infiltrated with lidocaine for local anesthetic. Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency. Under continuous ultrasound guidance, with permanent recording and reporting, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018\" wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire. Through the micropuncture introducer set, an 0.035\" wire was advanced into the IVC under fluoroscopic guidance. A sheath was placed at the access site, as detailed. A catheter and/or sheath combination was advanced into the IVC and cavography was then performed, with findings detailed above.  Under direct fluoroscopic guidance, the filter described above was positioned and deployed through the delivery system. A repeat venogram was performed, documenting appropriate positioning.  All instruments and devices were removed and hemostasis achieved with manual compression. No immediate complication occurred, and the patient was discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.

An ultrasound image documenting vein patency was stored to PACS. 2.\tThe port catheter has a smooth course with the tip terminating near the cavoatrial junction.  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful placement of a tunneled right internal jugular 8 French single lumen Medcomp power Port-A-Cath using sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance.  Treatment Plan:   The catheter tip is in good position. The line flushes and aspirates appropriately.  The catheter is okay to use.  Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines). Procedure was performed with anesthesia. Please refer to anesthesia notes for details. The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Subsequently, the right chest was anesthetized with lidocaine solution , both with and without epinephrine. An incision was made. A port pocket was created. The port reservoir was placed within the port pocket after adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The port was not affixed to the chest wall with suture.  The catheter was tunneled under the skin of the right  chest.   Under fluoroscopic guidance, a peel-away sheath was advanced through the venotomy site over a guide wire to the level of the right atrium. The catheter was inserted through the peel-away sheath and into the  internal jugular vein  via a peel-away sheath after removal of the dilator and wire. Static fluoroscopic image was obtained documenting the tip of the port catheter in good position near the cavoatrial junction. The port flushes and aspirates appropriately.   The port pocket was closed with buried, interrupted subcutaneous 3-0 absorbable sutures. A running 4-0 absorbable subcuticular stitch and  Dermabond was used to close the skin.  The access site was sealed with     Dermabond.   The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate post procedural complication.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): None Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): Hilary Karp, PA-C  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.7 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  6.41 mGy  Conscious Sedation: procedure was performed with anesthesia   Medications: Refer to anesthesia notes  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I, Hilary Karp PA C. performed the procedure. Dr. J. Kim was the attending of record.",

Impression:   1. Technically successful percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and drainage catheter placement. 2. Technically successful gallbladder mass biopsy under ultrasound guidance.    Plan:  1.\tOpen to bag drainage for 24 hours.  2.\tRoutine drain exchange in 8 weeks.  Technique:   The anterior abdominal wall and bilateral flanks were prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier.  An appropriate skin entry site was identified using fluoroscopy and ultrasound, and anesthetized with local.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 22G Chiba needle was advanced into the liver.  A bile duct was entered and the biliary system was opacified with contrast. Cholangiographic images were obtained.  Two-stick technique: A suitable duct for drain placement was then identified on the right. Under direct sonographic guidance, a right duct was accessed with a second 22 gauge Chiba needle.  A 0.018\" wire was passed centrally, and the needle exchanged for a nonvascular access catheter. The inner stiffener, dilator, and 0.018\" wire were removed and contrast was injected to confirm location.  A 0.035\" glidewire and 4 French angled catheter were negotiated into the small bowel. The glidewire was removed and contrast was injected to confirm location. A 0.035\" Amplatz wire was placed through the catheter, and the catheter subsequently removed.   Drain placement: Finally, an 10.2 French     internal-external biliary drain was placed over the wire. The anchor/loop was formed and locked. Attention was paid that side holes were positioned within the biliary system. Contrast was injected to confirm location. The catheter was secured to the skin with 2-0 suture material and attached to gravity drainage. A sterile dressing was applied.  Contrast was injected through the existing biliary drainage catheter and cholangiographic images obtained.  The procedure was well tolerated, and the patient discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.  Biopsy: Under ultrasound guidance an introduced was advanced into the gallbladder mass. Via the introducer an 18G mission biopsy needle was advanced into the gallbladder mass and biopsy was obtained. Samples were sent in formalin. Gel foam tract embolization was performed via the introducer. The needle was removed and sterile dressing applied.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Bryson Hauck Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 40 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 36 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  324 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Anesthesia  Medications: See anesthesia notes  Antibiotics: Rocephin, 2 g IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

The right renal cortex was atrophic and poorly visualized. No right hydronephrosis was seen.  2.\tLeft antegrade nephrostogram was performed with moderate hydronephrosis and no passage of contrast urinary bladder. 3.\tNephrostomy tube appropriately positioned within the left renal pelvis.  Catheter(s):  8.5 F     nephrostomy tube  Impression:   1.\tUneventful ultrasound and fluroscopic-guided placement of a left nephrostomy tube as described above.      Treatment Plan:   Patient should return for routine check and change in 8-12 weeks.        Technique:   The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure and sedation were explained to the patient. Written informed consent was obtained.  A time out/call to order was performed prior to procedure initiation.  The soft tissues overlying the access site were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Ultrasound was utilized to identify an appropriate access site. Static ultrasound image was obtained and stored to PACS for reference purposes. Subsequently, under fluoroscopic and real-time concurrent ultrasound guidance, access was obtained into a posterior, inferior calyx using a 21 ga needle and a triaxial sheath system (Neff). Local anesthetic was injected at the catheter entry site. A wire was advanced centrally. Serial dilation was accomplished over the wire. The wire and inner dilator were removed. Non-ionic contrast was injected into the collecting system and images of the antegrade pyelogram were obtained and stored to PACS.  An 0.035” wire was advanced through the existing access. A nephrostomy tube was advanced over the wire and the Cope loop formed and locked in the renal pelvis. Contrast injection confirmed location. The catheter was sutured to the flank with monofilament suture and attached to gravity drainage. A sterile dressing was applied.  The procedure was well tolerated, and patient discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.        Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Bryson Hauck Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 40 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 1.7 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  22 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Anesthesia  Medications: See anesthesia notes  Antibiotics: See MAR  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Impression:   1. Technically successful percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and drainage catheter placement. 2. Technically successful gallbladder mass biopsy under ultrasound guidance.    Plan:  1.\tOpen to bag drainage for 24 hours.  2.\tRoutine drain exchange in 8 weeks.  Technique:   The anterior abdominal wall and bilateral flanks were prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier.  An appropriate skin entry site was identified using fluoroscopy and ultrasound, and anesthetized with local.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 22G Chiba needle was advanced into the liver.  A bile duct was entered and the biliary system was opacified with contrast. Cholangiographic images were obtained.  Two-stick technique: A suitable duct for drain placement was then identified on the right. Under direct sonographic guidance, a right duct was accessed with a second 22 gauge Chiba needle.  A 0.018\" wire was passed centrally, and the needle exchanged for a nonvascular access catheter. The inner stiffener, dilator, and 0.018\" wire were removed and contrast was injected to confirm location.  A 0.035\" glidewire and 4 French angled catheter were negotiated into the small bowel. The glidewire was removed and contrast was injected to confirm location. A 0.035\" Amplatz wire was placed through the catheter, and the catheter subsequently removed.   Drain placement: Finally, an 10.2 French     internal-external biliary drain was placed over the wire. The anchor/loop was formed and locked. Attention was paid that side holes were positioned within the biliary system. Contrast was injected to confirm location. The catheter was secured to the skin with 2-0 suture material and attached to gravity drainage. A sterile dressing was applied.  Contrast was injected through the existing biliary drainage catheter and cholangiographic images obtained.  The procedure was well tolerated, and the patient discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.  Biopsy: Under ultrasound guidance an introduced was advanced into the gallbladder mass. Via the introducer an 18G mission biopsy needle was advanced into the gallbladder mass and biopsy was obtained. Samples were sent in formalin. Gel foam tract embolization was performed via the introducer. The needle was removed and sterile dressing applied.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Bryson Hauck Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 40 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 36 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  324 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Anesthesia  Medications: See anesthesia notes  Antibiotics: Rocephin, 2 g IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a double lumen power-injectable, 5 Fr, 22 cm, tunneled non-cuffed central venous catheter via the right internal jugular vein.  Treatment Plan:   Routine catheter care.  The catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed below.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a peel-away sheath set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture peel-away sheath set, the wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.  Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Brandon Lei Fellow(s): Dr. Ross Bittman Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 2 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  8.1 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 30 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 0 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       The attending radiologist, Brandon Lei, MD, was available for procedural supervision and interpreted the images.",

GJ tube clogged.  Procedure:  GJ tube contrast evaluation and catheter replacement \t\t\t   Findings:  1. The existing catheter is appropriately positioned with its distal tip in the left lower quadrant jejunal loop . 2. The new GJ tube is appropriately positioned with sideholes in the stomach and the jejunal tip in left lower quadrant jejunal loop.   3. The entry site is clean dry and intact.  Impression:   Uneventful contrast evaluation with replacement of an 18 French  ballooned gastrojejunostomy tube as described.  Plan:   Routine exchange in 6 months. No crushed medications through the jejunal port.    Technique:  The anterior abdominal wall was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Contrast was injected, confirming catheter location.  A 0.035” stiff angled Glidewire was advanced through the existing catheter and positioned well beyond the ligament of Treitz.  The existing catheter was removed over the wire and discarded.  A new, 18 French  GJ tube was advanced over the wire.  The balloon was inflated with 10  mL tap water.   The wire was removed.   Both lumens were injected to confirm location.  The procedure was well-tolerated, and the patient was discharged from the angio suite in satisfactory condition.    Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 20 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.9 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  5 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 60 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: 100 mcg IV fentanyl  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

    "text": "DIAGNOSTIC CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM  CLINICAL INDICATION: Previously ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm, status post coil embolization x2  PROCEDURE: Diagnostic cerebral angiogram.  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 30 minutes.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] was the fellow. Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Left internal carotid artery  ANESTHESIA: Local in the right groin with bupivacaine. Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by the nurse present during the entire procedure. The patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Sedation was administered by a specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 30 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Heparin 3000 units IV Protamine 20 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.035\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Boston [VENDOR] sheath 5 French Simmons 3 Glide catheter  Mynx Closure Device Visipaque-270 contrast material (40 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the [VENDOR]mons catheter in the left internal carotid artery for better delineation of the anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Mynx closure device followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Cerebral angiogram dated March 20, 2023.  FINDINGS:  LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a coil mass at the site of the previously treated anterior communicating artery aneurysm. There is a small amount of coil compaction and residual aneurysm neck, better described on the 3-D angiogram below. This appears grossly stable compared to prior. There is no focal stenosis or early draining vein  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated recurrent anterior communicating artery aneurysm neck, measuring approximately 2.6 x 3.7 millimeters (dome-to-neck by neck).  COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: 1. There is a recurrent anterior communicating artery aneurysm neck, measuring approximately 2.6 x 3.7 millimeters (dome to neck by neck). This appears stable compared to prior angiogram based on the 2-D images.     Frank C Tong, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a  15.5 French, 23 cm (tip-to-cuff), tunneled large bore central venous catheter via the right internal jugular vein.  Treatment Plan:   1. Routine catheter care. 2. The catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed above.  The skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle. An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the dialysis catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of a peel-away sheath.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Bryson Hauck Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.6 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  3.46 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 40 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 0.5 mg IV. Fentanyl 25 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a power-injectable, 5 Fr, 23 cm, tunneled non-cuffed single lumen central venous catheter via the left internal jugular vein.       Treatment Plan:   Routine catheter care.  The catheter is ready for immediate use.        Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed below.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the left internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the left internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the left internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a peel-away sheath set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.          Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s): Dr. Ross Bittman Resident(s):     Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 1.1 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  1.23 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 30 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 2 mg IV. Fentanyl 100 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Bryan N Swilley, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

Treatment Plan:   1. Routine catheter care. 2. The catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed below.  The skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle. An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the dialysis catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of a peel-away sheath.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.  Procedural Personnel Advanced practice provider(s): Eric Peterson, PA-C  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 1.1 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  13.1 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 15 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 0.5 mg IV. Fentanyl 0 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I Eric Peterson, PA-C did the above procedure. Dr. Tina Sankhla was the attending of the day",

An ultrasound image documenting vein patency was stored to PACS. 2.\tThe port catheter has a smooth course with the tip terminating near the cavoatrial junction.  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful placement of a tunneled right internal jugular 8 French single lumen Bard power Port-A-Cath using sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance.  Treatment Plan:   The catheter tip is in good position. The line flushes and aspirates appropriately.  The catheter is okay to use.  Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed above.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Subsequently, the right chest was anesthetized with lidocaine solution , both with and without epinephrine. An incision was made. A port pocket was created. The port reservoir was placed within the port pocket after adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The port was not affixed to the chest wall with suture.  The catheter was tunneled under the skin of the right  chest.   Under fluoroscopic guidance, a peel-away sheath was advanced through the venotomy site over a guide wire to the level of the right atrium. The catheter was inserted through the peel-away sheath and into the  internal jugular vein  via a peel-away sheath after removal of the dilator and wire. Static fluoroscopic image was obtained documenting the tip of the port catheter in good position near the cavoatrial junction. The port flushes and aspirates appropriately.   The port pocket was closed with buried, interrupted subcutaneous 2-0 absorbable sutures. A running 4-0 absorbable subcuticular stitch and  Dermabond was used to close the skin.  The access site was sealed with a single subcuticular stitch and Dermabond.   The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate post procedural complication.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Bryson Hauck Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.8 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  2 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 40 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Vein patency was documented by ultrasound and stored to PACS. 2.  The catheter tip terminates near the cavoatrial junction.       3. Real-time US images through the left groin collection demonstrate appropriate percutaneous drainage.   Impression:   1.\tUneventful image guided placement of 5 French, 50 cm double-lumen PICC in the left upper extremity as described. The lumens flush and aspirate appropriately.       2.\tAttempted drainage of a left groin fluid collection. The drainage catheter was aspirated and only scant viscous blood products were returned. The drain was subsequently removed.  Treatment Plan:   Catheter tip position is confirmed as above. It is OK to use this line.  Continue to monitor clinically. Can reattempt drainage if there is worsening of the left groin collection  Technique PICC:   The site was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).   Ultrasound evaluation of the left basilic vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS. Local anesthetic was used over the access site. Under ultrasound guidance, the left basilic vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS.    A 0.018\" wire was passed centrally and the needle exchanged for a dilator peel-away combination. The wire was used to determine catheter length, and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line cut to appropriate length. The tailored catheter was advanced through the peel-away and positioned centrally using fluoroscopy.   The peel-away was removed, and hemostasis achieved with manual compression. The catheter was aspirated, flushed, and locked per protocol. It was secured in place with Ethilon.  An antimicrobial disc and sterile dressing were applied.  Technique Drain:  Target: Left groin collection Imaging: US+CT Drain: 10.2 Fr Cook Drainage: 1-2 mL bloody fluid aspirated during procedure Microbiology: Sample sent  A superficial skin entry site was selected based on available imaging and the overlying skin entry site was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier to target the above collection. The skin surface was anesthetized with 1-2% lidocaine. Using continuous real-time grayscale and/or color doppler ultrasound guidance, a needle was introduced into the target site and imaging guidance confirmed adequate positioning. The access device was utilized with an 0.035\" wire to introduce the drainage catheter listed above following any necessary serial dilatation. Ultrasound images confirmed appropriate positioning within the target structure. The catheter was secured to the skin surface using nonabsorbable suture material and dressed in typical fashion. Any samples not sent to laboratory for analysis were discarded. Given minimal output the drain was cut and removed.The patient tolerated the procedure and was sent to the recovery area for monitoring.          Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Bryson Hauck Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 6 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  33 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 0 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 0 mg IV. Fentanyl 0 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Request is made for port placement  Procedure: After explaining the technique, risks, benefits, alternatives, and answering all questions, informed consent was obtained from the patient. Timeout identifying the correct patient, procedure, site, allergies was performed and observed by the operating team. The patient was positioned supine with the head turned to the left. The procedure is performed under continuous physiologic monitoring. The patient received intravenous conscious sedation using Versed 2.5 mg and fentanyl 125 mcg.  Also the patient received Ancef 2 g IV.  The left side of the lower neck and upper chest was prepped with Betadine followed by chlorhexidine and draped in a sterile fashion.  Following administration of local anesthesia using lidocaine 1% with epinephrine 8ml at the left side of the root of the neck, under ultrasound  guidance, access was obtained into the left internal jugular vein using a micropuncture device. A 0.018\" guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the vein centrally. Further administration of local anesthesia using lidocaine 1% with epinephrine 10 mL into the left infraclavicular region. A transverse 3.5  cm incision was performed and a pocket created inferior to the incision to accommodate the port using both sharp and blunt dissection. Through the infraclavicular incision, the port tubing 8 F was tunneled exiting at the root of the neck following a nick incision at the exit of the guidewire. The guidewire was upgraded to 0.035\" guidewire that was advanced under fluoroscopy through the SVC into the IVC. A peel-away sheath was advanced over the guidewire. Following removal of the guidewire and the stiffener, the port tubing was advanced after trimming to a length of 23.7 cm. The sheath was peeled away and the line was buried in the subcutaneous tissues. The tip of the line is at the SVC/upper right atrium. The port was tested demonstrating easy aspiration and injection and was flushed with normal saline followed by hep saline as per protocol. The port was anchored in the subcutaneous tissues using nonabsorbable 2/0 interrupted stitches. The wound was irrigated. Hemostasis secured. The incision at the root of the neck was closed using Dermabond. The infraclavicular incision was closed using subcutaneous followed by subcuticular Vicryl 4/0 continuous stitches. Steri-Strips were applied followed by Sterile occlusive dressing. The patient tolerated to the procedure well. There were no intraprocedural complications. The patient was transferred to recovery in stable condition and eventually discharged. The port is ready to use. Please also refer to the Procedure note placed in the patient's EPIC chart on the date of the procedure.  Fluoroscopy time: 00:35.5 min.  Device implanted: 8F single lumen power port, LOT #REHW1854, REF #5608062.  Fellows: None. Residents: None.  IMPRESSION: 1. Uneventful ultrasound fluoroscopy guided placement of 8F Power  infusion port in the left internal jugular vein. The port is ready to use.  Voice recognition is used in generating this report.",

Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Versed 1 mg IV Fentanyl 25 mcg IV Heparin 3000 units IV Protamine 20 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 5 French Cordis vert catheter  Cardiva Vascade Visipaque contrast material (110 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the right internal carotid artery for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Vascade followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: None.  FINDINGS: RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a large right MCA bifurcation aneurysm, better described on the 3-D angiogram below. There is no focal stenosis or early draining vein identified.   RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified.   LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The cervical and intracranial ICA, MCA, and ACA branches do not demonstrate any aneurysm or focal stenosis. The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Reflux of contrast into the contralateral vertebral artery was not achieved. The origin of PICA is normal on the left.   RIGHT INNOMINATE ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm is identified arising from the right PICA. The previously described MCA bifurcation aneurysm is again visualized. No other new aneurysms are visualized. There is no focal stenosis or early draining vein.  3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated a 6.0 x 6.2 x 7.5 x 5.5 mm (transverse by transverse by dome to neck by neck) right MCA bifurcation aneurysm.   COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: 1. There is a 6.0 x 6.2 x 7.5 x 5.5 mm (transverse by transverse by dome to neck by neck) right MCA bifurcation aneurysm.   Charles M Cawley, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

The right nephrostomy tube is appropriately positioned. 2.\tNephrostography demonstrates hydronephrosis without drainage into the urinary bladder.   Catheter: Left 8.5 French modified PCN U, right 10.2 French by 25 cm PCN  Impression:   1.\tBilateral image guided nephrostomy tube re-placement.  Treatment Plan:   Patient should return for routine check and change in 6-8 weeks.  Technique:   The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure and sedation were explained to the patient. Written informed consent was obtained. A time out/call to order was performed prior to procedure initiation.  The existing catheter(s) and surrounding soft tissues were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Right: Local anesthetic was injected at the catheter entry site. A scout radiograph was obtained.  Non-ionic contrast was injected through the existing nephrostomy tube(s) and images of the collecting system obtained and stored to PACS.  An 0.035” wire was advanced through the nephrostomy tube. The tube was removed over the wire under direct fluoroscopic visualization. A new nephrostomy tube was advanced over the wire and the Cope loop formed and locked in the renal pelvis. Contrast injection confirmed appropriate location. The catheter was sutured to the flank with monofilament suture and attached to gravity drainage. A sterile dressing was applied.  Left: Local anesthetic was injected at the catheter entry site. A scout radiograph was obtained.  Non-ionic contrast was injected through the existing nephrostomy tube(s) and images of the collecting system obtained and stored to PACS.  An 0.035” wire was advanced through the nephrostomy tube. The tube was removed over the wire under direct fluoroscopic visualization. Several attempts with different catheter types were made to perform the cope loop within the renal pelvis, however, the pelvis was too small/stenotic to accommodate the loop. The decision was made to place a modified PCN U given ability to form the loop within the pelvis. Contrast injection confirmed appropriate location. The catheter was sutured to the flank with monofilament suture and attached to gravity drainage. A sterile dressing was applied.   The procedure was well tolerated, and patient discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.    Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Bryson Hauck Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 60 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 13 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  45 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 60 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 2 mg IV. Fentanyl 100 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: Rocephin, 2 g IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Vein patency was documented by ultrasound and stored to PACS. 2.  The catheter tip terminates near the cavoatrial junction.       3. Real-time US images through the left groin collection demonstrate appropriate percutaneous drainage.   Impression:   1.\tUneventful image guided placement of 5 French, 50 cm double-lumen PICC in the left upper extremity as described. The lumens flush and aspirate appropriately.       2.\tAttempted drainage of a left groin fluid collection. The drainage catheter was aspirated and only scant viscous blood products were returned. The drain was subsequently removed.  Treatment Plan:   Catheter tip position is confirmed as above. It is OK to use this line.  Continue to monitor clinically. Can reattempt drainage if there is worsening of the left groin collection  Technique PICC:   The site was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).   Ultrasound evaluation of the left basilic vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS. Local anesthetic was used over the access site. Under ultrasound guidance, the left basilic vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS.    A 0.018\" wire was passed centrally and the needle exchanged for a dilator peel-away combination. The wire was used to determine catheter length, and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line cut to appropriate length. The tailored catheter was advanced through the peel-away and positioned centrally using fluoroscopy.   The peel-away was removed, and hemostasis achieved with manual compression. The catheter was aspirated, flushed, and locked per protocol. It was secured in place with Ethilon.  An antimicrobial disc and sterile dressing were applied.  Technique Drain:  Target: Left groin collection Imaging: US+CT Drain: 10.2 Fr Cook Drainage: 1-2 mL bloody fluid aspirated during procedure Microbiology: Sample sent  A superficial skin entry site was selected based on available imaging and the overlying skin entry site was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier to target the above collection. The skin surface was anesthetized with 1-2% lidocaine. Using continuous real-time grayscale and/or color doppler ultrasound guidance, a needle was introduced into the target site and imaging guidance confirmed adequate positioning. The access device was utilized with an 0.035\" wire to introduce the drainage catheter listed above following any necessary serial dilatation. Ultrasound images confirmed appropriate positioning within the target structure. The catheter was secured to the skin surface using nonabsorbable suture material and dressed in typical fashion. Any samples not sent to laboratory for analysis were discarded. Given minimal output the drain was cut and removed.The patient tolerated the procedure and was sent to the recovery area for monitoring.          Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Bryson Hauck Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 6 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  33 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 0 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 0 mg IV. Fentanyl 0 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

    "text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Female Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL].[ID].[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  Pancreatic cancer  Procedure:   1.\tGastrostomy tube placement under fluoroscopic guidance.  Findings:   1.\tThe gastrostomy tube is in good position.  2.\tGentle hand injection of contrast material confirms positioning of the gastrostomy tube within the gastric lumen.  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful placement of 18 French MIC gastrostomy tube as above.  Treatment Plan:   The tube should be placed to gravity drainage and should not be used for 24 hours. 25 cc of water can be administered per hour. At 4 hours, if residuals are less than 30%, the patient can have tube feeds advanced starting at a half dose.   Technique:   Informed consent for the procedure was obtained, and time-out was performed prior to the procedure.  The skin overlying the access site was subsequently prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the mid abdomen were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.   Using fluoroscopic and ultrasonographic guidance, an appropriate puncture site was identified.  3 T-fasteners were placed adjacent to the planned tube access site. Positioning of the T-fasteners within the gastric lumen was confirmed by return of air and direct injection of contrast material.  Next, under fluoroscopic guidance, an 18-gauge needle was directed into the gastric lumen. Needle positioning within the gastric lumen was confirmed with aspiration of air as well as gentle hand injection of contrast material.  A wire was advance through the 18-gauge needle.  The 18-gauge needle was removed over a wire. Serial dilation was accomplished over the stiff wire. An 18 French Halyard G-tube was advanced over a wire in an antegrade fashion and advanced through the anterior abdominal wall. All wires and catheters were removed. The bulb was inflated with 10 mL of a 10% contrast mixture. Gentle hand injection of contrast material documents the gastric feeding tube within the gastric lumen. Static fluoroscopic image was obtained for reference purposes. The tube was flushed with saline. It was affixed to the anterior abdominal wall with a rubber flange. The patient tolerated the procedure well at time of procedure completion without complication.        Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Bryson Hauck Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 40 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 4.3 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  75 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 60 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 0.5 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

IVUS utilized during case  Impression: Right common and external iliac veins are patent without hemodynamically significant narrowing or pelvic collaterals.  Left common and external iliac veins are patent without hemodynamically significant narrowing or pelvic collaterals.  Left renal vein is patent without hemodynamically significant narrowing, mild gonadal vein reflux with valsalva.  Left ovarian venography confirms right vein is abnormally dilated with reflux into the pelvis with abnormally dilated left periuterine veins  Successful left ovarian vein embolization/sclerotherapy with STS foam, coils, and Gelfoam. Postembolization left renal venogram shows patent left renal vein without reflux into the left ovarian vein.  Findings: VENOGRAPHY: The following vessels were catheterized and diagnostic venography was performed:  RIGHT COMMON ILIAC VEIN: Venogram: Right common and external iliac veins are patent without stenosis. No abnormal pelvic collaterals.  IVUS utilize: Yes. No stenosis.  LEFT COMMON ILIAC VEIN: Venogram: Left common and external iliac veins are patent without stenosis. No abnormal pelvic collaterals.  IVUS utilized: Yes. No stenosis.  LEFT RENAL VEIN: Venogram: Left renal vein is patent without hemodynamically significant narrowing, mild gonadal vein reflux with valsalva.   IVUS utilized: Yes, no renal vein stenosis.  Left ovarian vein: Venogram: Ovarian vein mildly dilated up to 6 mm. Contrast flows caudally and pools in prominent pelvic collaterals.  INTERVENTION:  Embolization of the left ovarian vein Embolic: 6 cc STS foam Balt coils 4 mm x 35 cm, 3 mm x 20 cm, 3.5 mm x 30 cm 2 cc Gelfoam slurry  POST INTERVENTION: Venogram: No visualized pelvic collaterals to the left common iliac vein IVUS utilized: Yes. Patent stent with no stenosis of the common iliac vein.  Technique: Access site(s): Right Internal jugular vein  The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure and sedation were explained to the patient. The specific risks of bleeding, infection, and nontarget embolization were explained.  Written informed consent was obtained. A timeout was performed.  The patient was placed supine on the angiography table and the right neck prepped and draped in sterile fashion.   Under ultrasound guidance, the right jugular vein was accessed with a 21-gauge needle. Vein patency and needle entry were stored to PACS. A 0.018\" wire was advanced, and the needle exchanged for a transitional dilator. An 0.035 wire was negotiated into the IVC. A short 8 French sheath was placed at the neck and flushed.  An angled catheter was used to select the right external iliac vein and venography and IVUS were performed with findings as above. Procedure was repeated for the left side.  An angled catheter was used in combination with a Glidewire to select the left renal vein. Left renal venography was performed with and without Valsalva with findings as above.  The angled catheter and Glidewire were used to selectively catheterize the left ovarian vein. Left ovarian venography was performed. A Rosen wire was placed, and the catheter removed over the wire. A long 6 French sheath was advanced to the midportion of the left ovarian vein. A 4 French Fogarty balloon was advanced over the wire. The balloon was inflated, and the volume of the pelvic veins estimated via contrast injection. The catheter was flushed and the veins were cleared.  A sclerosing solution with 3:2:1 Air:STS:Lipiodol was then infused through the Fogarty under direct fluoroscopic visualization. Subsequently, a microcatheter was advanced through the Fogarty and coil embolization was performed.  Gelfoam slurry was used between each coil pack.   The catheter was removed and repeat, post-embolization left renal venography performed to assess embolic effect.  Catheter and wire were then used to attempt cannulation of the right ovarian vein, however was unable to select this vein from the jugular approach.  The catheters and sheaths were removed and hemostasis achieved with compression.  The procedure was well-tolerated and the patient was discharged to the post-procedure care area in satisfactory condition.    Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Tina Sankhla MD  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 100 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 32.5 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  949 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 130 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: See MAR  Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

    "text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Female Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL].[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  Breast cancer. This patient had a right jugular port placed on [DATE]. When she presented to the infusion center, they could not find the port. Two-view chest x-ray showed the port had fallen into the soft tissues of the lower right anterolateral chest wall. She came today for port replacement and removal of the malpositioned port.   Procedure:  Right jugular single lumen chest port placement with imaging Removal of malpositioned right sided chest port  Findings:   1. The Right internal jugular vein is ultrasonographically patent and compresses.  Needle entry was stored to PACS. 2. The port catheter has a smooth course with the tip terminating in the right atrium.  3. The malpositioned port is identified in the anterior soft tissues of the right lower lateral chest wall. 4. Final image shows complete removal of the malpositioned port.    Impression:   Uneventful image guided placement of right internal jugular  power port catheter as described.  The malpositioned port was removed without incident.    Technique:  Image guided placement of right jugular single lumen chest port:   The right neck and chest wall region was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Using local anesthetic and ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein vein was punctured with a 21 gauge needle. A PACS image was stored.  A 0.018\" wire was passed centrally and the needle exchanged for a 5 French transitional dilator. The smaller wire was exchanged for a 0.035\" wire.  A peel-away sheath was placed at the venotomy.   The soft tissues caudal and lateral to the sheath entry site were anesthetized with lidocaine with epinephrine. A #15 blade was used to incise the skin.  Blunt and sharp dissection were used to create a subcutaneous pocket.  The pocket was irrigated with antibiotic solution.  A tunneling tool was brought from the pocket to the venotomy. The catheter was brought through the tunnel.  During suspended respiration, the catheter was advanced through the peel-away and positioned centrally using fluoroscopy. The peel-away sheath was removed and hemostasis achieved with manual compression. The catheter was flushed, cut to length and attached to the port reservoir. The reservoir was aspirated, flushed, and heparinized per protocol.  It was sutured into the pocket using a single 2-0 Ethilon suture.  The pocket was closed using absorbable Vicryl suture and Dermabond and a running subcuticular stitch.  The venotomy was closed with Dermabond. A sterile dressing was applied. Attention was redirected to removal of the malpositioned port.  Removal of malpositioned right chest port:  The port reservoir was fluoroscopically identified. Local was injected into the scarred skin over the port reservoir. A #15 blade was used to incise the skin. The port reservoir was identified and grasped with a hemostat. The port reservoir and catheter were removed in their entirety. The pocket was irrigated and packed. Finally, 2 interrupted 3-0 absorbable Vicryl sutures were placed. Dermabond was placed on the skin. The site was sterilely dressed.  The procedure was well tolerated, and the patient discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Gail Peters Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): Tram Vu, PA-C  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 1.7 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  12.83 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 90 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 3 mg IV. Fentanyl 200 mcg IV   Antibiotics: 2 g IV Ancef  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.

G-tube and J-tube dependent. The J-tube is completely clogged and leaking. Both were due for routine replacement on [DATE].  Procedure:   Gastrostomy tube contrast evaluation  and replacement   Jejunostomy tube evaluation and replacement/upsizing\t    Findings:  1. The existing 18 French ballooned gastrostomy is adequately positioned. 2. The new gastrostomy tube is adequately positioned within the gastric lumen. 3. The jejunostomy tube enters the left lower quadrant and has its tip in a right lower quadrant jejunal loop. 4. The jejunal tube is completely clogged. A wire could not be passed. 5. The new 20 French jejunostomy tube was modified by shortening it 4 inches and adding 3 additional sideholes. 6. The jejunal tube has its tip in a right right lower quadrant jejunal loop.    Impression:   Uneventful image guided gastrostomy tube replacement as described above.  Difficult but successful replacement of a left lower quadrant jejunostomy tube. The tube was completely clogged. It was upsized to 20 French and modified by placing additional sideholes distally.  Procedure:  The anterior abdominal wall and existing gastric and jejunal catheters were prepped and draped in sterile fashion. A scout radiograph was obtained.  Gastrostomy tube:  Contrast was injected. The existing tube was removed over a Glidewire. A new 18 French gastrostomy tube was advanced over the glide. An 8 French long dilator was necessary to provide support enough to into the gastric lumen. The dilator and wire were removed and contrast injection showed appropriate position. The balloon was inflated with 10 mL sterile water.  Jejunostomy tube:  Attempts were made at passing several different wires through the completely occluded jejunal tube. Ultimately, it was cut and partially withdrawn. A stiff glide was advanced through the tube along with a 5 French angled catheter. The tube was removed over the wire and discarded. A new 20 French jejunostomy tube was modified by shortening/removal of the last 4 inches. 3 additional sideholes were created distally. It was then preloaded with a 5 French angled catheter and advanced over the wire. The balloon was inflated with 5 mL sterile water. Contrast injection confirmed placement.  The site was dressed.  The procedure was well-tolerated, and the patient was discharged from the angio suite in satisfactory condition.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Gail Peters Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 20 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 2.1 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  6.42 mGy  Conscious Sedation: None  Medications: None  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

An ultrasound image documenting vein patency was stored to PACS. 2.\tThe port catheter has a smooth course with the tip terminating near the cavoatrial junction.  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful placement of a tunneled right internal jugular 8 French double lumen Medcomp power Port-A-Cath using sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance.  Treatment Plan:   The catheter tip is in good position. The line flushes and aspirates appropriately.  The catheter is okay to use.  Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed below.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Subsequently, the right chest was anesthetized with lidocaine solution , both with and without epinephrine. An incision was made. A port pocket was created. The port reservoir was placed within the port pocket after adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The port was not affixed to the chest wall with suture.  The catheter was tunneled under the skin of the right  chest.   Under fluoroscopic guidance, a peel-away sheath was advanced through the venotomy site over a guide wire to the level of the right atrium. The catheter was inserted through the peel-away sheath and into the  internal jugular vein  via a peel-away sheath after removal of the dilator and wire. Static fluoroscopic image was obtained documenting the tip of the port catheter in good position near the cavoatrial junction. The port flushes and aspirates appropriately.   The port pocket was closed with buried, interrupted subcutaneous 3-0 absorbable sutures. A running 4-0 absorbable subcuticular stitch and  Dermabond was used to close the skin.  The access site was sealed with     Dermabond.   The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate post procedural complication.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): None Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): Hilary Karp, PA-C  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.8 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  10 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 20 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I, Hilary Karp PA C. performed the procedure. Dr. F Edalat was the attending of record.",

Procedure:   1.\tRight nephrostogram 2.\tUnsuccessful attempted right percutaneous nephroureterostomy tube placement   Findings:   1.\tRight nephrostogram: Staghorn calculus extending into the lower pole calyces. There is contrast filling the dilated to superior pole calyces and stenotic interpolar calyx. Contrast flows from the right superior pole calyx into the ureter.   Impression:   Unsuccessful attempt at right percutaneous nephroureterostomy tube placement.   Treatment Plan:  1. Chest radiograph post procedure (ordered). 2. Attempt will be made by urology team in the operating room.    Technique:   The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure and sedation were explained to the patient. Written informed consent was obtained.  A time out/call to order was performed prior to procedure initiation.  The soft tissues overlying the access site were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Ultrasound was utilized to identify an appropriate access site. Static ultrasound image was obtained and stored to PACS for reference purposes. Subsequently, under fluoroscopic and real-time concurrent ultrasound guidance, access was obtained into a superior pole calyx infundibulum using a 21 ga needle. Contrast was injected for a right nephrostogram.   Under fluoroscopic guidance, 22-gauge Chiba needle was advanced into an inferior pole calyx until there was contact with the stone. Contrast was injected through the Chiba needle. A 0.018 inch (Nitrix) guidewire and then subsequently a 0.016 inch glidewire were attempted to be advanced through the Chiba needle and stones without success. This was repeated for a second stone-containing inferior pole calyx, again without success.  Attention was directed to the upper pole calyx. Less than 5 cc of air was injected through the initial 21-gauge access needle to determine posterior superior pole calyx. Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 22-gauge Chiba needle was advanced into the air-containing superior pole calyx. After confirmation with contrast injection, a 0.018 inch (Nitrix) guidewire and then subsequently a 0.016 inch glidewire were attempted to be advanced through the Chiba needle without success, given the acute angle of the access and the calyx.  Attention was directed to the contrast-containing interpolar calyx. Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 22-gauge Chiba needle was advanced into the interpolar calyx. After confirmation with contrast injection, a 0.018 inch (Nitrix) guidewire and then subsequently a 0.016 inch glidewire were attempted to be advanced through the Chiba needle without success given infundibular stenosis.  The needles were removed.   The procedure was well tolerated, and patient discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.        Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Faramarz Edalat Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 20 mL Omnipaque into the right renal collecting system  Fluoroscopy time: 35.4 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  1392.39 mGy  Conscious Sedation: None. Procedure performed under general anesthesia.  Medications: Please see patient's electronic medical records for medications administered.  Antibiotics: Rocephin 2 g IV.  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

    "text": "DIAGNOSTIC CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM  CLINICAL INDICATION: This is a 66 years Male with past medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, tobacco use, who presented in [DATE] with perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage. An angiogram at that time was negative. Patient now presents for 3-month diagnostic cerebral angiography    PROCEDURE: Diagnostic cerebral angiogram.  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 45 minutes.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] was the fellow. Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right internal carotid artery Right external carotid artery Left internal carotid artery Left external carotid artery Left vertebral artery  ANESTHESIA: Local in the right groin with bupivacaine. Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by the nurse present during the entire procedure. The patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Sedation was administered by a specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for the duration of the procedure as outlined above (Total intra service time, 45 minutes). Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Versed 1 mg IV Fentanyl 50 mcg IV Heparin 3000 units IV Protamine 20 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter  5 French Vascade closure device Visipaque-270 contrast material (80 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the diagnostic catheter in the left internal carotid artery for better delineation of the underlying angioarchitecture. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a 5 French Vascade closure device  followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Cerebral angiogram November 20, 2023.  FINDINGS: RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. There is mild intracranial atherosclerotic disease at the cavernous and supraclinoid internal carotid artery segments.  RIGHT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No new aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. The previously seen medially directed outpouching just proximal to the ophthalmic segment is better seen on the 3-D angiogram below.  LEFT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally. No arteriovenous shunting is identified to suggest a dural arteriovenous fistula.   LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Reflux of contrast into the contralateral vertebral artery was achieved. The origin of PICA is normal bilaterally.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated a small medially directed outpouching just proximal to the takeoff of the left ophthalmic artery, seen on prior 3-D angiogram and stable in size, likely extradural.  COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: 1. No etiology for patient's previous perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage was identified on this angiogram. 2. There is a small medially directed outpouching of the internal carotid artery just proximal to the ophthalmic artery takeoff, previously thought to represent intracranial atherosclerotic disease, stable from prior. This lesion is also likely extradural.  Charles M Cawley, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

    "text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Male Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL].[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  CVA with dysphagia  Procedure:   1.\tGastrostomy tube placement under fluoroscopic guidance.  Findings:   1.\tThe gastrostomy tube is in good position.  2.\tGentle hand injection of contrast material confirms positioning of the gastrostomy tube within the gastric lumen.  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful placement of 18 French MIC gastrostomy tube as above.  Treatment Plan:   The tube should be placed to gravity drainage and should not be used for 24 hours. 25 cc of water can be administered per hour. At 4 hours, if residuals are less than 30%, the patient can have tube feeds advanced starting at a half dose.   Technique:   Informed consent for the procedure was obtained, and time-out was performed prior to the procedure.  The skin overlying the access site was subsequently prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the mid abdomen were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.   Using fluoroscopic and ultrasonographic guidance, an appropriate puncture site was identified.  3 T-fasteners were placed adjacent to the planned tube access site. Positioning of the T-fasteners within the gastric lumen was confirmed by return of air and direct injection of contrast material.  Next, under fluoroscopic guidance, an 18-gauge needle was directed into the gastric lumen. Needle positioning within the gastric lumen was confirmed with aspiration of air as well as gentle hand injection of contrast material.  A wire was advance through the 18-gauge needle.  The 18-gauge needle was removed over a wire. Serial dilation was accomplished over the stiff wire. An 18 French Halyard G-tube was advanced over a wire in an antegrade fashion and advanced through the anterior abdominal wall. All wires and catheters were removed. The bulb was inflated with 10 mL of a 10% contrast mixture. Gentle hand injection of contrast material documents the gastric feeding tube within the gastric lumen. Static fluoroscopic image was obtained for reference purposes. The tube was flushed with saline. It was affixed to the anterior abdominal wall with a rubber flange. The patient tolerated the procedure well at time of procedure completion without complication.        Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Bryson Hauck Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 40 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 3.7 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  14 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 40 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. Fentanyl 100 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Presumed hepatorenal syndrome. Needs long-term HD.  Procedure:   1.\tTunneled large bore central venous catheter placement 2.\tRemoval of non-tunneled large bore central venous catheter.   Findings:   1.\tThe right internal jugular vein is sonographically patent and compressible.  2.\tNewly placed large bore central venous catheter tip terminates in the right atrium.  Impression:   1.\tplacement of a tunneled hemodialysis catheter   Catheter: 15.5-Fr., 19 cm (tip-to-cuff), tunneled large bore central venous catheter via the right internal jugular vein.   Treatment Plan:   1. Routine catheter care. 2. The catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).   The skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a 21-g needle. An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018-in wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018-in wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035-in Amplatz wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the dialysis catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of a peel-away sheath.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   With the new access established. The pre-existing large bore central venous catheter was then removed. Hemostasis was achieved with manual compression and Dermabond.  The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  Patient tolerated the procedure well.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Hearns Charles Fellow(s): Dr. Joseph Henain Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: none  Fluoroscopy time: 1.3 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  6 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 45 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Please see separate anesthesia documentation.   Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  Hearns Charles, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

Procedure:   1.\tVenous access with ultrasound guidance   2.\tPort insertion under fluoroscopic guidance  Catheter: Power-injectable  8 F single-lumen port (standard profile)  Findings:   1.\tThe right internal jugular vein is ultrasonographically patent and compresses. An ultrasound image documenting vein patency was stored to PACS. 2.\tThe port catheter has a smooth course with the tip terminating near the cavoatrial junction.  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful placement of a tunneled right internal jugular 8 French single lumen power Port-A-Cath using sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance.  Treatment Plan:   The catheter tip is in good position. The line flushes and aspirates appropriately.  The catheter is okay to use.  Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed above.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Subsequently, the right chest was anesthetized with lidocaine solution , both with and without epinephrine. An incision was made. A port pocket was created. The port reservoir was placed within the port pocket after adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The port was not affixed to the chest wall with suture.  The catheter was tunneled under the skin of the right  chest.   Under fluoroscopic guidance, a peel-away sheath was advanced through the venotomy site over a guide wire to the level of the right atrium. The catheter was inserted through the peel-away sheath and into the  internal jugular vein  via a peel-away sheath after removal of the dilator and wire. Static fluoroscopic image was obtained documenting the tip of the port catheter in good position near the cavoatrial junction. The port flushes and aspirates appropriately.   The port pocket was closed with buried, interrupted subcutaneous 2-0 absorbable sutures. Dermabond was used to close the skin.  The access site was sealed with a single subcuticular stitch and Dermabond.   The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate post procedural complication.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Faramarz Edalat Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.7 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  6 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 20 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Please see patient's electronic medical records were medications administered.  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Treatment Plan:   The catheter tip is in good position. The line flushes and aspirates appropriately.  The catheter is okay to use.  Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed above.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the left internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the left internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the left internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  10 cc of contrast was used for venogram to show patency of the SVC. Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Subsequently, the left chest was anesthetized with lidocaine solution , both with and without epinephrine. An incision was made. A port pocket was created. The port reservoir was placed within the port pocket after adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The port was not affixed to the chest wall with suture.  The catheter was tunneled under the skin of the left chest.   Under fluoroscopic guidance, a peel-away sheath was advanced through the venotomy site over a guide wire to the level of the right atrium. The catheter was inserted through the peel-away sheath and into the  internal jugular vein  via a peel-away sheath after removal of the dilator and wire. Static fluoroscopic image was obtained documenting the tip of the port catheter in good position near the cavoatrial junction. The port flushes and aspirates appropriately.   The port pocket was closed with buried, interrupted subcutaneous 3-0 absorbable sutures.     Dermabond was used to close the skin.  The access site was sealed with     Dermabond.   The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate post procedural complication.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): None Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): Hee Kang, PA-C  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 10 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 30.7 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  5.11 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 105 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 0.5 mg IV. Fentanyl 25 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: Ancef 2 g IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I Hee Kang, PA, performed the above procedure, Dr. Peter Park was the attending of the day.",

G-tube and J-tube dependent. The J-tube is completely clogged and leaking. Both were due for routine replacement on [DATE].  Procedure:   Gastrostomy tube contrast evaluation  and replacement   Jejunostomy tube evaluation and replacement/upsizing\t    Findings:  1. The existing 18 French ballooned gastrostomy is adequately positioned. 2. The new gastrostomy tube is adequately positioned within the gastric lumen. 3. The jejunostomy tube enters the left lower quadrant and has its tip in a right lower quadrant jejunal loop. 4. The jejunal tube is completely clogged. A wire could not be passed. 5. The new 20 French jejunostomy tube was modified by shortening it 4 inches and adding 3 additional sideholes. 6. The jejunal tube has its tip in a right right lower quadrant jejunal loop.    Impression:   Uneventful image guided gastrostomy tube replacement as described above.  Difficult but successful replacement of a left lower quadrant jejunostomy tube. The tube was completely clogged. It was upsized to 20 French and modified by placing additional sideholes distally.  Procedure:  The anterior abdominal wall and existing gastric and jejunal catheters were prepped and draped in sterile fashion. A scout radiograph was obtained.  Gastrostomy tube:  Contrast was injected. The existing tube was removed over a Glidewire. A new 18 French gastrostomy tube was advanced over the glide. An 8 French long dilator was necessary to provide support enough to into the gastric lumen. The dilator and wire were removed and contrast injection showed appropriate position. The balloon was inflated with 10 mL sterile water.  Jejunostomy tube:  Attempts were made at passing several different wires through the completely occluded jejunal tube. Ultimately, it was cut and partially withdrawn. A stiff glide was advanced through the tube along with a 5 French angled catheter. The tube was removed over the wire and discarded. A new 20 French jejunostomy tube was modified by shortening/removal of the last 4 inches. 3 additional sideholes were created distally. It was then preloaded with a 5 French angled catheter and advanced over the wire. The balloon was inflated with 5 mL sterile water. Contrast injection confirmed placement.  The site was dressed.  The procedure was well-tolerated, and the patient was discharged from the angio suite in satisfactory condition.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Gail Peters Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 20 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 2.1 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  6.42 mGy  Conscious Sedation: None  Medications: None  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a  15.5 French, 19 cm (tip-to-cuff), tunneled large bore central venous catheter via the right internal jugular vein.  Treatment Plan:   1. Routine catheter care. 2. The catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed above.  The skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle. An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the dialysis catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of a peel-away sheath.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.

Potential narrowing at the caval anastomosis seen on MRI.  Procedure:   1.\tUS-guided right IJ venous access 2.\tHepatic and inferior vena cava venography with pressure measurements 3.\tRight lower quadrant paracentesis.  Findings:    1.\tVenography demonstrates patent hepatic venous anastomosis with no apparent stricture, and widely patient infrahepatic IVC, hepatic IVC, and cavoatrial junction.  2.\tPressure measurements suggesting portal hypertension, no significant venous stenosis:   Free hepatic vein: 18 mm Hg Wedged hepatic vein: 29 mm Hg HVPG:  11 mm Hg   Central hepatic vein (inferior to anastomosis): 18 mm Hg Cavo-atrial junction (superior to anastomosis): 14 mm Hg Right atrial: 12 mm Hg   Infrahepatic IVC: 21 mm Hg IVC just below anastomosis: 20 mm Hg Cavo-atrial junction (superior to anastomosis) (repeat measurement): 16 mm Hg   3. 3800mL dark brown tinged fluid removed from RLQ.  Albumen not giving.   Impression:   Successful venography and paracentesis as above.  Treatment Plan:   Per transplant team.  Technique:   The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure and sedation were explained.  The specific risks of bleeding, infection, pulmonary embolism, filter maldeployment, and filter migration were detailed and accepted. Written informed consent was obtained. The patient was assessed for conscious sedation and found to be an adequate candidate. A dedicated nurse monitored heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation throughout the procedure. Patient was brought to the procedure suite and a time out was performed prior to procedure initiation. The right neck and right lower quadrant was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.   Paracentesis: An appropriate access site in the right lower quadrant identified using ultrasound. The 5 French centesis catheter was advanced into the abdomen under direct ultrasound guidance, and connected to suction. After all free fluid was removed, the catheter was removed and a sterile dressing was applied.  Venography: The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the access site were infiltrated with lidocaine for local anesthetic. Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency. Under continuous ultrasound guidance, with permanent recording and reporting, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018\" wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire. Through the micropuncture introducer set, an 0.035\" wire was advanced into the IVC under fluoroscopic guidance. A 5 French sheath was placed at the access site. A multipurpose angled catheter was advanced into the hepatic veins and IVC and venography was performed, with pressure measurements as above.  All instruments and devices were removed and hemostasis achieved with manual compression. No immediate complication occurred, and the patient was discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Bryan Nicholas Swilley Fellow(s): Dr. Ross Bittman Resident(s):     Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 40 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 5.1 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  51 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 50 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 2 mg IV. Fentanyl 100 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Bryan N Swilley, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

Potential narrowing at the caval anastomosis seen on MRI.  Procedure:   1.\tUS-guided right IJ venous access 2.\tHepatic and inferior vena cava venography with pressure measurements 3.\tRight lower quadrant paracentesis.  Findings:    1.\tVenography demonstrates patent hepatic venous anastomosis with no apparent stricture, and widely patient infrahepatic IVC, hepatic IVC, and cavoatrial junction.  2.\tPressure measurements suggesting portal hypertension, no significant venous stenosis:   Free hepatic vein: 18 mm Hg Wedged hepatic vein: 29 mm Hg HVPG:  11 mm Hg   Central hepatic vein (inferior to anastomosis): 18 mm Hg Cavo-atrial junction (superior to anastomosis): 14 mm Hg Right atrial: 12 mm Hg   Infrahepatic IVC: 21 mm Hg IVC just below anastomosis: 20 mm Hg Cavo-atrial junction (superior to anastomosis) (repeat measurement): 16 mm Hg   3. 3800mL dark brown tinged fluid removed from RLQ.  Albumen not giving.   Impression:   Successful venography and paracentesis as above.  Treatment Plan:   Per transplant team.  Technique:   The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure and sedation were explained.  The specific risks of bleeding, infection, pulmonary embolism, filter maldeployment, and filter migration were detailed and accepted. Written informed consent was obtained. The patient was assessed for conscious sedation and found to be an adequate candidate. A dedicated nurse monitored heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation throughout the procedure. Patient was brought to the procedure suite and a time out was performed prior to procedure initiation. The right neck and right lower quadrant was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.   Paracentesis: An appropriate access site in the right lower quadrant identified using ultrasound. The 5 French centesis catheter was advanced into the abdomen under direct ultrasound guidance, and connected to suction. After all free fluid was removed, the catheter was removed and a sterile dressing was applied.  Venography: The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the access site were infiltrated with lidocaine for local anesthetic. Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency. Under continuous ultrasound guidance, with permanent recording and reporting, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018\" wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire. Through the micropuncture introducer set, an 0.035\" wire was advanced into the IVC under fluoroscopic guidance. A 5 French sheath was placed at the access site. A multipurpose angled catheter was advanced into the hepatic veins and IVC and venography was performed, with pressure measurements as above.  All instruments and devices were removed and hemostasis achieved with manual compression. No immediate complication occurred, and the patient was discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Bryan Nicholas Swilley Fellow(s): Dr. Ross Bittman Resident(s):     Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 40 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 5.1 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  51 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 50 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 2 mg IV. Fentanyl 100 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Bryan N Swilley, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a 14 French,  20 cm, non-tunneled large bore central venous catheter via the left internal jugular vein.  Treatment Plan:   Routine catheter care. The catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Local anesthesia was used for this procedure   The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the left internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic. Ultrasound evaluation of the vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS. Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS.  A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, a 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of the catheter over the wire. The catheter was subsequently introduced over the wire and the wire removed. The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): None Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): [HCW]  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 1.1 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  6.3 mGy  Local anesthesia was used for this procedure.  Medications: Versed 0 mg IV. Fentanyl 0 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I Hee Kang, PA, performed the above procedure, Dr. Kamil Arif was the attending of the day.",

Plan for chemotherapy with thrombocytopenia and oncology team does not want to continue anticoagulation    Procedure:   1.\tUS-guided right IJ venous access 2.\tInferior vena cava filter placement  Findings:  Inferior vena cavogram: Single renal veins bilaterally without aberrant anatomy (no duplicated IVC or accessory renal veins). The IVC is normal in caliber and without caval thrombus. Filter placed: Argon option elite Inferior vena cavogram post-deployment: Appropriate positioning below the renal veins without significant filter tilt. No evidence of thrombosis, perforation, or other complication.  Impression:   1.  Uneventful image guided placement of an infrarenal IVC filter.  Treatment Plan:  1. Patient will f/u in IR clinic for consultation for possible filter removal.  Technique:   The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure and sedation were explained.  The specific risks of bleeding, infection, pulmonary embolism, filter maldeployment, and filter migration were detailed and accepted. Written informed consent was obtained. The patient was assessed for conscious sedation and found to be an adequate candidate. A dedicated nurse monitored heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation throughout the procedure. Patient was brought to the procedure suite and a time out was performed prior to procedure initiation. The right neck was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.   The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the access site were infiltrated with lidocaine for local anesthetic. Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency. Under continuous ultrasound guidance, with permanent recording and reporting, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018\" wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire. Through the micropuncture introducer set, an 0.035\" wire was advanced into the IVC under fluoroscopic guidance. A sheath was placed at the access site, as detailed. A catheter and/or sheath combination was advanced into the IVC and cavography was then performed, with findings detailed above.  Under direct fluoroscopic guidance, the filter described above was positioned and deployed through the delivery system. A repeat venogram was performed, documenting appropriate positioning.  All instruments and devices were removed and hemostasis achieved with manual compression. No immediate complication occurred, and the patient was discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Bryson Hauck Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 40 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 2.4 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  196 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 40 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 0 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Completion IVC venography  Findings:   1. Left internal jugular chest port with tip overlying the superior cavoatrial junction.  Port and catheter tubing appear intact. 2.  Venography demonstrates a fibrin sheath along the catheter.  Port does not aspirate blood properly before stripping. 3.  Successful stripping of fibrin sheath.  Normal venographic appearance through port catheter after stripping. After stripping, port catheter aspirates and flushes normally.  Impression:   Successful fibrin stripping of chest port.   Treatment Plan:   If port malfunctions in the future, will require additional stripping or replacement.  Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).    The port was accessed with a Huber needle. Contrast was injected through the needle into the port reservoir and port catheter. Digital subtraction angiograms were obtained under fluoroscopy. Images were reviewed and saved in PACS.   The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A micropuncture set was used to access the right common femoral vein under ultrasound guidance. Permanent ultrasound image was stored documenting needle entry. A 0.035 inch wire was advanced through the IVC into the SVC. A long 6 French sheath was advanced to the inferior cavoatrial junction. A 6 French 20 mm gooseneck snare was used to strip the port catheter. Venography after 3 strippings demonstrate near complete resolution of fibrin sheath. After 2 more strippings, venography demonstrated complete resolution of fibrin sheath. The port then was found to flush and aspirate normally.  The snare and sheath were removed from the right groin. Hemostasis was achieved with gentle manual compression. A sterile dressing was applied.  The access needle was removed from the port. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate postprocedural complication.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s): Dr. Ross Bittman Resident(s):     Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 20 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 12.9 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  65.1 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 45 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 2 mg IV. Fentanyl 100 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Tina Sankhla, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

Findings:   1.\tThe existing tube is a 22-French MIC gastrostomy tube   2.\tThe new tube is appropriately positioned within in the stomach.  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful exchange of 22 French MIC gastrostomy tube.      Treatment Plan:   It is OK to use the tube immediately.  Routine check and change recommended in 6 months.  Technique:   Informed consent for the procedure was obtained, and time-out was performed prior to the procedure.  The skin overlying the access site was subsequently prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines). The skin and subcutaneous tissue around the existing tube were infiltrated with local anesthetic. A scout image was obtained of the abdomen.  A wire was cannulated into the existing tube and passed into the gastric lumen. The pre-existing G-tube was removed over the wire after deflating the bulb. A new gastrostomy tube was advanced over the wire. The replacement tube overlies the stomach on static fluoroscopic image saved to PACS.  The balloon was inflated with 10 mL of a 10% contrast mixture. Gentle hand injection of contrast material documents the gastric feeding tube within the gastric lumen. The gastrostomy tube was flushed with saline.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW]  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL   Fluoroscopy time: 21.3 seconds Fluoroscopy dose:  5.16 mGy  Sedation: None  Medications: Lidocaine 1% local  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Patient requested a left chest port due to a tattoo on her right chest.  Procedure:   1.\tVenous access with ultrasound guidance   2.\tPort insertion under fluoroscopic guidance  Catheter: Power-injectable  8 F single-lumen Bard port (standard profile)  Findings:   1.\tThe left internal jugular vein is ultrasonographically patent and compresses.  2.\tThe port catheter has a smooth course with the tip terminating in the proximal right atrium.  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful placement of a tunneled left internal jugular 8 French single lumen Bard power Port-A-Cath using sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance.  Treatment Plan:   The catheter tip is in good position. The line flushes and aspirates appropriately.  The catheter is okay to use.  Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed above.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the left internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 1% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the left internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency.  Under ultrasound guidance, the left internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Subsequently, the left chest was anesthetized with lidocaine solution , both with and without epinephrine. An incision was made. A port pocket was created. The port reservoir was placed within the port pocket after adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The port was not affixed to the chest wall with suture.  The catheter was tunneled under the skin of the left chest.   Under fluoroscopic guidance, a peel-away sheath was advanced through the venotomy site over a guide wire to the level of the right atrium. The catheter was inserted through the peel-away sheath and into the  internal jugular vein  via a peel-away sheath after removal of the dilator and wire. Static fluoroscopic image was obtained documenting the tip of the port catheter in good position in the proximal right atrium. The port flushes and aspirates appropriately.   The port pocket was closed with buried, interrupted subcutaneous 2-0 absorbable sutures.  Dermabond and Steri-Strips were used to close the skin.  The access site was sealed with  Dermabond and Steri-Strips.   The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate post procedural complication.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Steven Faerstain, MD  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL   Fluoroscopy time: 2.3 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  15.68 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 30 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 2 mg IV. Fentanyl 100 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: Vancomycin, 1 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

    "text": "DIAGNOSTIC CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM  CLINICAL INDICATION: Incidental right ophthalmic artery aneurysm  PROCEDURE: Diagnostic cerebral angiogram.  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 30 minutes.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] was the fellow. Both actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right internal carotid artery Left common carotid artery Left vertebral artery  ANESTHESIA: Local in the right groin with bupivacaine. Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by the nurse present during the entire procedure. The patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Sedation was administered by a specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 30 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 10 cc  Heparin 3000 units IV Protamine 20 mg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.035\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Boston Scientific sheath 5 French Cordis Vertebral catheter  5 French Simmons 3 glide catheter Mynx Closure Device Visipaque-270 contrast material (60 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery; a 5 French sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery. 3000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement. Using fluoroscopic guidance, selective catheterization was done of these above mentioned vessels and digital angiograms were performed, centered over the head and neck with AP, Lateral and Oblique views.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the Cordis vert catheter in the right internal carotid artery for better delineation of the right ophthalmic artery aneurysm. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY:  Rotational angiography was also performed from the Cordis vert catheter in the left common carotid artery for better delineation of the any possible aneurysms. Three-dimensional angiographic images were processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.    Following completion of the procedure, heparin was reversed with protamine. Hemostasis was obtained by the application of a Mynx closure device followed by manual compression.  COMPARISON: Noninvasive imaging.  FINDINGS: RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a superiorly directed ophthalmic artery aneurysm better described on the 3-D angiogram below. There is no evidence of focal stenosis or early draining vein identified. There is mild fibromuscular dysplasia in the cervical right internal carotid artery.  LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified.  The visualized ECA branches opacify normally.   LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified. Reflux of contrast into the  contralateral vertebral artery was achieved. The origin of PICA is normal bilaterally.   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated a superiorly directed ophthalmic artery aneurysm measuring approximately 4.1 x 3.8 x 4.0 mm (transverse by dome to neck by neck). Distal to this aneurysm there is another aneurysmal dilation measuring approximately 2.4 x 0.7 x 3.6 mm (transverse by dome to neck by neck)..   3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY: 3D Rotational angiography with volume-rendered three-dimensional reconstruction on an independent workstation, demonstrated no aneurysm or focal stenosis. Of note there is a fenestrated anterior communicating artery.   COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: 1. There is a superiorly directed right ophthalmic artery aneurysm measuring approximately 4.1 x 3.8 x 4.0 mm (transverse by dome to neck by neck) with a distal aneurysmal dilation measuring approximately 2.4 x 0.7 x 3.6 mm (transverse by dome to neck by neck)..  2. Mild fibromuscular dysplasia in the cervical right internal carotid artery.     Frank C Tong, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a power-injectable, 5 Fr, 17 cm, tunneled non-cuffed central venous catheter via the right internal jugular vein.       Treatment Plan:   Routine catheter care.  The catheter is ready for immediate use.        Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed below.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a peel-away sheath set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture peel-away sheath set, the wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.  Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.          Procedural Personnel Attending(s): None Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): Hee Kang, PA-C  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.7 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  5.52 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 30 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I Hee Kang, PA, performed the above procedure, Dr. Kamil Arif was the attending of the day.",

Catheter(s):  8.5 F bilateral nephrostomy tubes  Impression:   Uneventful ultrasound and fluroscopic-guided placement of bilateral nephrostomy tubes as above.      Treatment Plan:   Patient should return for routine check and change in 8-12 weeks.     Technique:   LEFT PCN PLACEMENT: The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure and sedation were explained to the patient. Written informed consent was obtained.  A time out/call to order was performed prior to procedure initiation. The soft tissues overlying the access site were prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Ultrasound was utilized to identify an appropriate access site. Static ultrasound image was obtained and stored to PACS for reference purposes. Subsequently, under fluoroscopic and real-time concurrent ultrasound guidance, access was obtained into a posterior, inferior calyx using a 21 ga needle and a triaxial sheath system ([VENDOR]). Local anesthetic was injected at the catheter entry site. A wire was advanced centrally. Serial dilation was accomplished over the wire. The wire and inner dilator were removed. Non-ionic contrast was injected into the collecting system and images of the antegrade pyelogram were obtained and stored to PACS. An 0.035” wire was advanced through the existing access. A nephrostomy tube was advanced over the wire and the Cope loop formed and locked in the renal pelvis. Contrast injection confirmed location. The catheter was sutured to the flank with monofilament suture and attached to gravity drainage. A sterile dressing was applied.

Subsequently, under fluoroscopic and real-time concurrent ultrasound guidance, access was obtained into a posterior, inferior calyx using a 21 ga needle and a triaxial sheath system (Accustick). Local anesthetic was injected at the catheter entry site. A wire was advanced centrally. Serial dilation was accomplished over the wire. The wire and inner dilator were removed. Non-ionic contrast was injected into the collecting system and images of the antegrade pyelogram were obtained and stored to PACS. An 0.035” wire was advanced through the existing access. A nephrostomy tube was advanced over the wire and the Cope loop formed and locked in the renal pelvis. Contrast injection confirmed location. The catheter was sutured to the flank with monofilament suture and attached to gravity drainage. A sterile dressing was applied.    The procedure was well tolerated, and patient discharged from the angiography suite in satisfactory condition.        Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Peter Park Fellow(s): Dr. Ross Bittman Resident(s):     Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 30 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 3.4 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  32 mGy  Anesthesia: Refer to anesthesia documentation  Medications: Refer to anesthesia documentation  Antibiotics: Patient is already on scheduled IV antibiotics as inpatient.  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Peter Park, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

Celiac artery: Tumoral blush identified. Posterior branch of the right hepatic artery: Tumoral blush identified. Proximal branch of the left hepatic artery: Tumoral blush identified. Anterior branch of the right hepatic artery: Tumoral blush identified.  Specific technical notes / catheter selection: None.  CBCT: Yes Catheter location:  - Posterior branch of the right hepatic artery - Proximal branch of the left hepatic artery - Anterior branch of the right hepatic artery Findings: Tumoral blush identified with supply from the target vessel.  Embolization: No Vessel embolized: N/a Coils used: N/a  MAA delivery performed from:  - 50% posterior branch of the right hepatic artery (series 21 image 1) - 25% proximal branch of the left hepatic artery, supplying the caudate lobe (series 29 image 1) cbct 6036 - 25% posterior branch of the right hepatic artery (series 39 image 1)  Future target Y90 delivery catheter position(s): Same as where MAA was delivered.CBCT 6036 caudate (25%), CBCT 6066 seg7(50%), CBCT 6066 seg 4a (25%) Treatment device: SIRTEX Split-Dose: .yes Dosimetry Model: MIRD dosed to the right lobe/segment. Desired lobar/tumoral (if partition) dose: 80-150 (unless split) Gy Additional details:     5cm seg7 LR5 (mr se7im11)  1.8cm caudate LR5 (mr se7im17) CBCT 6036 1.5cm seg4a/8 LR5 (mr se7im10) CBCT 6066 2.5cm seg8 LR4 (mr se7im14) CBCT 1.1cm seg4a/8 LR4 (mr se20im22) CBCT   IMPRESSION:   Successful Yttrium-90 SIRsphere selective internal radiotherapy mapping.  TREATMENT PLAN:  1. Patient will return in 2-4 weeks for Y90 radioembolization. 2. Access site precautions and orders placed.  TECHNIQUE:  With the patient in the supine position, the left wrist was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. The left wrist was evaluated with ultrasound and left radial artery patency and acceptable size criteria were documented and images were properly stored in PACS. A modified Allen test (Barbeau test B) was performed on the left wrist to confirm patency of the ulnopalmar arch using pulse oximetry.   1% lidocaine solution was administered for local anesthesia. Access was obtained to the left radial artery using a 21 gauge micro needle and ultrasound guidance. Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. Permanent recording and reporting of the saved image and study into the PACS system was performed. A wire was placed through the needle. A hydrophilic Glidesheath was advanced slowly over the wire. 3000 units of heparin, 200 mcg of nitroglycerin and 2.5 mg of verapamil was given through the arterial sheath with slow hemodilution. A side flush was started.   A 5-Fr Jacky/Sarah catheter was advanced over an 0.035\" wire into the abdominal aorta. The catheter was used to catheterize the visceral vessels described below. Angiograms were performed. A microcatheter system was used to catheterize distal visceral and hepatic vessels, as described below. Specific vessels catheterized and embolized are described in detail below. Tumor blush was confirmed on angiography.  Cone Beam CT (CBCT) was performed intraprocedurally for purposes of treatment planning, targeting and dose calculation. Axial and coronal images were created and 3D reconstruction was performed on a separate dedicated workstation under concurrent supervision.  After confirmation of target treatment vessel, 5 mCi of Tc-99 MAA was injected slowly in this location though the catheter.   All catheters and wires were removed from the patient. A TR Band was placed on the left wrist for hemostasis. The access sheath was removed and no hematoma was seen. A radial artery pulse was confirmed distal to the puncture site confirming patent hemostasis.   The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition without any immediate postprocedural complications. The patient was transferred to the Nuclear Medicine department for imaging.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Meghan Lilly Fellow(s): Dr. Kevin Beker Szomstein Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 325 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 42.6 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  1643 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 190 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 2 mg IV. Fentanyl 100 mcg IV. Dilaudid 1 mg  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Meghan Lilly, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

Port removal under fluoroscopic guidance 2. Venous access with ultrasound guidance   3. Port insertion under fluoroscopic guidance  Catheter: Power-injectable  8 F single-lumen Bard port (standard profile)  Findings:   1.\tThe right internal jugular vein is ultrasonographically patent and compresses. An ultrasound image documenting vein patency was stored to PACS. 2.\tThe port catheter has a smooth course with the tip terminating near the cavoatrial junction.  Impression:   1. Successful removal of port catheter en bloc 2. Successful placement of a tunneled right internal jugular 8 French single lumen Bard power Port-A-Cath using sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance.  Treatment Plan:   The catheter tip is in good position. The line flushes and aspirates appropriately.  The catheter is okay to use.  Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed above.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Subsequently, the right chest was anesthetized with lidocaine solution , both with and without epinephrine. An incision was made. The port pocket was accessed using sharp and blunt dissection. The port catheter was removed en bloc.   Next a new port reservoir was placed within the port pocket after adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The port was not affixed to the chest wall with suture.  The catheter was tunneled under the skin of the right  chest.   Under fluoroscopic guidance, a peel-away sheath was advanced through the venotomy site over a guide wire to the level of the right atrium. The catheter was inserted through the peel-away sheath and into the  internal jugular vein  via a peel-away sheath after removal of the dilator and wire. Static fluoroscopic image was obtained documenting the tip of the port catheter in good position near the cavoatrial junction. The port flushes and aspirates appropriately.   The port pocket was closed with buried, interrupted subcutaneous 2-0 absorbable sutures. A running 4-0 absorbable subcuticular stitch and  Dermabond was used to close the skin.  The access site was sealed with a single subcuticular stitch and Dermabond.   The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate post procedural complication.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Bryson Hauck Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 1.2 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  12 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Anesthesia   Medications: See MAR  Antibiotics: Ancef, 2 gm IV  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Dominant lesion in segment 4a.  Additional Clinical Information: Breast carcinoma with liver metastases  PROCEDURE:  Y90 Shunt study/mapping using MAA  1. US-guided left radial artery access. 2. Diagnostic visceral angiography 3. MAA delivery Cone-beam CT performed for intraprocedural localization, as detailed below.  FINDINGS: ANGIOGRAPHY: Vessels catheterized and angiograms performed, as follows:  Superior mesenteric artery: No replaced or accessory hepatic arterial supply. Celiac artery: Tumoral blush identified. Segment 4 hepatic artery: Tumoral blush identified. Right hepatic artery: Multifocal Tumoral blush identified.  Specific technical notes / catheter selection: Sarah Radial 5fr x 110cm, Progreat 2.4, Transend 14 190cm   CBCT: Yes Catheter location: Proper hepatic artery Findings: Tumoral blush identified with supply from the target vessel.  Catheter location: Segment 4 hepatic artery Findings: Tumoral blush identified with supply from the target vessel.  Catheter location: Right hepatic artery Findings: Tumoral blush identified with supply from the target vessel.  Embolization: No  MAA delivery performed from: Segment 4 hepatic artery (series 10), Right hepatic artery (series 14) Future target Y90 delivery catheter position(s): Segment 4  and right hepatic arteries (Series 10 and series 14 respectively) Treatment device: SIRTEX Split-Dose: Yes  Dosimetry Model: Segment 4: MIRD dosed to segment 4A with target dose of 250 Gy, 4 day pre-cal Right Hepatic Lobe:  Partition dosed to the right lobe, 2 day pre-cal  Desired lobar/tumoral (if partition) dose: Highest dose possible with maximum non-target dose set to 60 Gy  Additional details:  1. Will initially deliver the dose for segment 4 radiation segmentectomy.  After 4 weeks, we will then deliver the right lobar dose based on patient's clinical status/labs.  PLEASE PERFORM TWO SEPARATE DOSIMETRIES BASED ON SHUNT STUDY. 2. Right hepatic artery position (series 14) is distal to the cystic artery.  3. Will use TriNav catheter for delivery of right hepatic artery lobar dose  IMPRESSION:   Successful Yttrium-90 SIR-Spheres selective internal radiotherapy mapping.  TREATMENT PLAN:  1. Patient will return in 2-4 weeks for Y90 radioembolization. 2. Access site precautions and orders placed.  TECHNIQUE:  With the patient in the supine position, the left wrist was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. The left wrist was evaluated with ultrasound and left radial artery patency and acceptable size criteria were documented and images were properly stored in PACS. A modified Allen test (Barbeau test Type A) was performed on the left wrist to confirm patency of the ulnopalmar arch using pulse oximetry.   1% lidocaine solution was administered for local anesthesia. Access was obtained to the left radial artery using a 21 gauge micro needle and ultrasound guidance. Real time ultrasound visualization was performed of the vascular needle entering the vessel. Permanent recording and reporting of the saved image and study into the PACS system was performed. A wire was placed through the needle. A hydrophilic Glidesheath was advanced slowly over the wire. 3000 units of heparin, 200 mcg of nitroglycerin and 2.5 mg of verapamil was given through the arterial sheath with slow hemodilution. A side flush was started.   A 5-Fr Sarah catheter was advanced over an 0.035\" wire into the abdominal aorta. The catheter was used to catheterize the visceral vessels described below. Angiograms were performed. A microcatheter system was used to catheterize distal visceral and hepatic vessels, as described below. Specific vessels catheterized and embolized are described in detail below. Tumor blush was confirmed on angiography.  Cone Beam CT (CBCT) was performed intraprocedurally for purposes of treatment planning, targeting and dose calculation. Axial and coronal images were created and 3D reconstruction was performed on a separate dedicated workstation under concurrent supervision.  After confirmation of target treatment vessel, 5 mCi of Tc-99 MAA was injected slowly in this location though the catheter.   All catheters and wires were removed from the patient. A TR Band was placed on the left wrist for hemostasis. The access sheath was removed and no hematoma was seen. A radial artery pulse was confirmed distal to the puncture site confirming patent hemostasis.   The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition without any immediate postprocedural complications. The patient was transferred to the Nuclear Medicine department for imaging.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Kamil Arif Fellow(s): Dr. Kwaku Opoku Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 150 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 17.4 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  664 mGy  Conscious Sedation: Please see separate anesthesia documentation. Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.

Procedure:   1.\tGJ-tube replacement.       Findings:   1.\tThe existing tube is terminating within the duodenum with a fundal loop 2.\tThe new tube is appropriately positioned with the distal aspect of the tube terminating in the portion of the jejunum  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful replacement of 18 French MIC gastrojejunostomy tube with tip in jejunum.      Treatment Plan:    It is OK to use the tube immediately.    Routine check and change recommended in 6 months.  Technique:   Informed consent for the procedure was obtained, and time-out was performed prior to the procedure.  The skin overlying the access site was subsequently prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines). The skin and subcutaneous tissue around the existing tube were infiltrated with local anesthetic.   A scout image was obtained over the abdomen.  A stiff Glidewire was cannulated into the J port of the pre-existing tube and passed into the jejunum. The pre-existing GJ tube was removed over the wire after deflating the bulb. A new gastrojejunostomy tube was advanced over the wire. Its tip was placed in the proximal jejunum. The wire was removed.  The bulb was inflated with 10 mL of a 10% contrast mixture.   Contrast injection confirmed appropriate positioning of the G and J side ports. The balloon was inflated and the disc was cinched.          Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 40 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 12 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  92 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 40 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a power-injectable, 5 Fr, 33 cm, tunneled non-cuffed central venous catheter via the left internal jugular vein.       Treatment Plan:   Routine catheter care.  The catheter is ready for immediate use.        Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Moderate sedation was administered via the medications listed below.  The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the left internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the left internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the left internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a peel-away sheath set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture peel-away sheath set, the wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.  Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.          Procedural Personnel Attending(s): None Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): Hee Kang, PA-C  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.5 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  2.33 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 30 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 1 mg IV. Fentanyl 50 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  I Hee Kang, PA, performed the above procedure, Dr. Kamil Arif was the attending of the day.",

    "text": "Patient Name:  [PATIENT]       DOB: [DATE]    SEX: Male Ordering Physician:  [HCW] Location:  [HOSPITAL]C.[ID]  Date of exam:  [DATE]   Clinical Indication:  HCC. Prior treatments with Y90 and microwave ablation. Persistent nodular residual disease on most recent MRI.  PROCEDURE:   1. US-guided right femoral artery access. 2. Diagnostic visceral angiography. 3. Transarterial chemoembolization segment 7 and segment 8 branches. 4. Transarterial bland embolization of the right phrenic artery. 5. Right common femoral artery angiogram and closure.  Cone-beam CT performed for intraprocedural localization, as detailed below.  FINDINGS: ANGIOGRAPHY: Vessels catheterized and angiograms performed, as follows:  Celiac artery: Conventional anatomy. Right hepatic artery: Extensive tumoral blush identified.  Posterior branch right hepatic artery: Tumoral blush identified. Anterior branch right hepatic artery: Tumoral blush identified.  Right phrenic artery: Vascular supply to the region of the previously treated tumor, without definite tumor blush.  Specific technical notes / catheter selection: 5 French sheath SOS2 catheter 2.4 Progreat microcatheter Fathom microwire  CBCT: Yes Catheter location: Right hepatic artery Findings: Tumoral blush identified with supply from the multiple branches of the anterior and posterior division.   Transcatheter embolization:  Tumor location: Segment 7/8  Embolic 1: Conventional TACE (50 mg doxorubicin in 5 mL contrast mixed 1:1 with lipiodol) for 10 mL total solution. Embolic 2: 2 vials 100-300 Embospheres  Phrenic artery embolization: Additional bland embolization of the right phrenic artery to substasis with 100-300 um embospheres.  IMPRESSION:   1. MAA shunt study aborted due to unfavorable multivascular supply to the tumor.  2. Successful conventional-TACE treatment of the segment 7/8 hepatocellular carcinoma.  3. Additional bland embolization to the right phrenic artery.  TREATMENT PLAN:  1. Patient will return to clinic in 6-8 weeks with abdominal MRI and labs.  2. Access site precautions and orders placed.  TECHNIQUE:  With the patient in the supine position, the groin was prepped and draped with maximum sterile barrier. The patient was placed on the table in a supine position. Following standard prepping and draping, the common femoral artery was punctured using a needle, and an .035 Bentson wire was advanced into the aorta. A 5-French vascular sheath was placed over the wire into the common femoral artery. A side flush was started.  A 5-Fr SOS2 catheter was advanced over an 0.035\" Bentson wire into the abdominal aorta. The catheter was used to catheterize the celiac artery. Angiograms and cone beam CT were performed and demonstrated multifocal vascular supply to the large segment 7/8 tumor, rendering the patient in unfavorable candidate. Additionally, cone beam CT showed favorable response to conventional chemotherapy performed along the superior margins of the tumor.   After conversation with the patient and his family, the decision was made to abandon MAA shunt study and pursue conventional TACE treatment. Consent was obtained from the patient's daughter, and doxorubicin was ordered from the pharmacy.  The above microwire/microcatheter system was used to catheterize distal the anterior and posterior divisions of the right hepatic artery, and chemoembolization was performed as detailed above. Follow-up contrasted and noncontrasted cone beam CTs confirmed successful treatment of the viable tumor, with minimal embolization of the normal hepatic parenchyma.  Attention was then turned to the phrenic artery, which previously demonstrated vascular supply to the superior aspects of the tumor. Phrenic artery was catheterized using a Mickelson. Repeat angiography today demonstrated vascular supply approaching the tumor, without definite tumoral blush. The decision was made to treat with bland embolization as detailed above.   A right common femoral artery angiogram was performed, demonstrating appropriate vascular access above the profunda femoris artery bifurcation. All catheters and wires were removed from the patient. Hemostasis was achieved using Perclose vascular closure device. The site was dressed in usual fashion.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the angiography suite in stable condition without any immediate postprocedural complications.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Bryan Nicholas Swilley Fellow(s): Dr. Joseph Henain Resident(s): None  Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 150 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 58.4 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  2196 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 180 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 3.5 mg IV. Fentanyl 250 mcg IV. Hydromorphone 0.5 mg Additional Medications: Benadryl 50 mg IV, Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV, Zofran 4 mg IV.  Antibiotics: Postop antibiotics sent to the pharmacy.  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.  Bryan N Swilley, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).  Local anesthesia was used for this procedure along with fentanyl  The skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle. An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Local anesthesia was then used to anesthetize a subcutaneous tunnel extending from the anterior chest to the venotomy site.  A small incision was made, and a blunt tunneling device was used to bring the dialysis catheter through the subcutaneous tunnel, exiting at the venotomy site.  The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of a peel-away sheath.  The catheter was then advanced through the peel-away sheath.  The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with nonresorbable suture.  The venotomy site was closed with skin glue.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): None Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): Hee Kang, PA-C  Complications: No immediate complications.

Findings:   1.\tThe existing tube is dislodged   2.\tThe new tube is appropriately positioned within in the stomach.  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful replacement of 18 French MIC gastrostomy tube.      Treatment Plan:   It is OK to use the tube immediately.  Routine check and change recommended in 6 months.  Technique:   Informed consent for the procedure was obtained, and time-out was performed prior to the procedure.  The skin overlying the access site was subsequently prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines). The skin and subcutaneous tissue around the existing tube were infiltrated with local anesthetic. A scout image was obtained of the abdomen.  A wire was cannulated into the gastric lumen using a Kumpe catheter. A new gastrostomy tube was advanced over the wire. The replacement tube overlies the stomach on static fluoroscopic image saved to PACS.  The balloon was inflated with 10 mL of a 10% contrast mixture. Gentle hand injection of contrast material documents the gastric feeding tube within the gastric lumen.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 40 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.3 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  1 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 0 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Versed 0 mg IV. Fentanyl 0 mcg IV.      Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",

An ultrasound image documenting vein patency was stored to PACS. 2.\tThe port catheter has a smooth course with the tip terminating near the cavoatrial junction.  Impression:   1.\tSuccessful placement of a tunneled right internal jugular 8 French single lumen Bard power Port-A-Cath using sonographic and fluoroscopic guidance.  Treatment Plan:   The catheter tip is in good position. The line flushes and aspirates appropriately.  The catheter is okay to use.  Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).   The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right internal jugular vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right internal jugular vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS.  Under ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.  The 0.018 wire was used to determine the intravascular length of the catheter.  Through the micropuncture introducer set, 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   Subsequently, the right chest was anesthetized with lidocaine solution , both with and without epinephrine. An incision was made. A port pocket was created. The port reservoir was placed within the port pocket after adequate hemostasis was achieved.  The port was not affixed to the chest wall with suture.  The catheter was tunneled under the skin of the right  chest.   Under fluoroscopic guidance, a peel-away sheath was advanced through the venotomy site over a guide wire to the level of the right atrium. The catheter was inserted through the peel-away sheath and into the  internal jugular vein  via a peel-away sheath after removal of the dilator and wire. Static fluoroscopic image was obtained documenting the tip of the port catheter in good position near the cavoatrial junction. The port flushes and aspirates appropriately.   The port pocket was closed with buried, interrupted subcutaneous 2-0 absorbable sutures. A running 4-0 absorbable subcuticular stitch and  Dermabond was used to close the skin.  The access site was sealed with a single subcuticular stitch and Dermabond.   The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate post procedural complication.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): Dr. Meghan Lilly Fellow(s): Dr. Kevin Beker Szomstein Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 1.2 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  2.84 mGy  Conscious Sedation: Local anesthesia only.  Medications: None.  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.

Impression:   1.\tUncomplicated image-guided placement of a 14 French X  30 cm, non-tunneled large bore central venous catheter via the right femoral vein.  Treatment Plan:   Routine catheter care. The catheter is ready for immediate use.   Technique:   The skin overlying the access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. All elements of maximal sterile barrier technique were followed including: cap and mask and sterile gown, sterile gloves, a large sterile sheet, and hand hygiene and 2% chlorhexidine for cutaneous antisepsis (or acceptable alternative antiseptics, per current guidelines).     The skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the right femoral vein were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine for local anesthetic. Ultrasound evaluation of the vein was performed demonstrating patency and an image was saved and stored to PACS. Under ultrasound guidance, the vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle.  An image was saved and stored to PACS.  A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle, and a micropuncture introducer set was advanced over the wire.       Through the micropuncture introducer set, a 0.035 wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.   The venotomy tract was dilated to allow introduction of the catheter over the wire. The catheter was subsequently introduced over the wire and the wire removed. The ports were tested to ensure adequate function, flushed and locked per protocol.   The catheter was sutured to the skin with 2-0 Prolene suture.  A sterile dressing was placed.  There were no immediate complications.  Ultrasound and fluoroscopic images were stored in PACS.  Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s): None Resident(s): [HCW] Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 0 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 0.1 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  0.77 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Please see anesthesia documentation  Medications: Versed 0 mg IV. Fentanyl 0 mcg IV. Please see anesthesia records  Antibiotics: None  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  H&P was performed. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.       Janice Newsome, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

    "text": "CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM AND ENDOVASCULAR PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION OF A RIGHT SUPERIOR HYPOPHYSEAL ARTERY ANEURYSM  CLINICAL INDICATION: 49-year-old female with a past medical history of tobacco use, hypertension, dyslipidemia who presented to [HOSPITAL] in [DATE] with high grade subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to a ruptured basilar tip aneurysm for which he underwent WEB embolization. She is also noted to have unruptured right pericallosal artery aneurysm and superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm. She made a remarkable recovery following her subarachnoid hemorrhage. Given her young age, good health, and history of ruptured aneurysm, treatment of her other aneurysms was indicated. She underwent craniotomy and clip ligation of the pericallosal aneurysm [DATE] this past year. She returns today for pipeline embolization of the right superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm.  PROCEDURE:  1.\tCerebral angiogram  2.\tEndovascular pipeline embolization   DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 2 hours.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] was the fellow. [HCW], PhD was the resident. Each actively participated in catheter manipulation and were present in the room for the entire procedure.  VESSELS CATHETERIZED: Right internal carotid artery Right middle cerebral artery Left vertebral artery Left internal carotid artery  VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: Right common femoral artery Right internal carotid artery Left vertebral artery Left internal carotid artery  VESSELS TREATED (in sequence): Right internal carotid  ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. Pre-, intra-, and post-anesthesia monitoring records are available in the chart.  MEDICATIONS:  Heparin 5000 units IV Ancef 2 grams IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 8 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 0.035\" Bentson Guidewire 0.035\" Terumo Glidewire (180 cm) 6 French 65 cm arrow  5 French Merit Performa Vertebral catheter 058 Navien guide catheter (115 cm) Phenom 27 microcatheter (150 cm) Asahi 018 microguidewire (200 cm) 3.25 mm x 12 mm pipeline embolization device 6 French Angio-Seal closure device Omnipaque-300 contrast (120 cc)  TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, stent thrombosis/stenosis, stent migration, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, non-target embolization, puncture site hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed, written consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite, intubated, and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Access to the vascular system was gained in the usual way by a single-wall puncture of the right femoral artery. Through the dilator sheath, an angiogram of the of the right common femoral artery was obtained to ensure the arteriotomy was above the level of the bifurcation and the CFA was of sufficient size to use the 6 French Angio-Seal closure device. 6 French 65 cm arrow sheath was introduced into the right femoral artery, and under fluoroscopic guidance was advanced into the proximal descending aorta over the Bentson wire. 5000 units of heparin were administered intravenously following sheath placement; additional boluses of heparin were administered at one-hour intervals. The ACT was checked to ensure that it was between 250-300.   The diagnostic catheter was used to select the right carotid artery. A roadmap angiogram right carotid artery was performed. The diagnostic catheter was advanced over the Terumo Glidewire into the right internal carotid artery. The arrow sheath was advanced over the diagnostic catheter into the right common carotid artery. Digital angiograms were performed centered over the head in the AP and lateral projections.  3D rotational angiography was performed with the selection catheter in the mid cervical segment of the right internal carotid artery to better delineate the right superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm and anatomy of the right intracranial ICA. The acquisition was processed on an independent workstation, and volume-rendered three-dimensional images were produced.   The diagnostic catheter was removed from the arrow sheath and the 058 Navien guide catheter was advanced over the Terumo Glidewire into the distal cervical segment of the right internal carotid artery using roadmap angiogram fluoroscopic guidance. The Glidewire was withdrawn.   A working projection was obtained to best demonstrate the neck of the superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm, as well as, the distal and proximal landing zones for the stent. Superselective catheterization of the right middle cerebral artery was performed with the Phenom 27 microcatheter over the Asahi 18 microguidewire. The tip of the microguidewire was situated in the distal M1/proximal M2 of the right MCA. The microguidewire in the pipeline catheter was then exchanged for a 3.25 mm x 12 mm pipeline embolization device. The device was deployed under fluoroscopic guidance and a single shot X-ray was performed to confirm that the distal and proximal ends of the pipeline embolization device were in the right ICA communicating segment and right ICA cavernous segment, respectively. There was good apposition of the device along its entire course and therefore postprocessing of the pipeline embolization device was not required.  A final AP and Lateral angiogram were completed to evaluate the distal vasculature for perfusion deficits and emboli.   Using fluoroscopic guidance,  the additional arteries  listed above were selectively catheterized. Digital angiograms were performed in the AP and lateral projections centered over the head and neck.   After completion of the procedure, the sheath was removed and hemostasis obtained using the 6 French Angio-Seal closure device. A Tegaderm were then applied over the puncture site.  COMPARISON: Diagnostic cerebral angiogram from outside institution from March of this past year.  FINDINGS: RIGHT COMMON FEMORAL ARTERY: Mild focal spasm of the proximal deep femoral artery related to access. The arteriotomy was above the level of the bifurcation and the CFA was of sufficient size to use the 6 French Angio-Seal closure device.   RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL:  There is a medially directed superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm, the dimensions of which are described on the 3-D angiography discussed below. Measurements of the ICA diameter were taken in very from 3.2 mm in the distal ophthalmic/proximal communicating segment to 2.8 mm in the cavernous segment. There is mild catheterization related vasospasm of the distal cervical ICA. The right middle meningeal artery originates from the distal cervical ICA.  RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL (POST-PIPELINE EMBOLIZATION): The Pipeline device is well apposed to the vessel walls throughout it's course without endoleak. . Stasis of contrast is noted within the aneurysm. . Once again there is noted to be mild to moderate catheter related spasm of the right ICA without flow limitation. No perfusion deficits to suggest distal emboli are present.  LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There is a WEB device seen in the expected location. There is no filling of the previously seen basilar apex aneurysm. Reflux of contrast into the  contralateral vertebral artery was achieved. The origin of PICA is normal bilaterally.   LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY, CEREBRAL: There are aneurysm clips seen in the expected location. There is no evidence of ongoing filling from the previously treated pericallosal aneurysm. No aneurysm, focal stenosis, or early draining vein are identified.     3D ROTATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHY: A 3D rotational angiogram of the  right internal carotid artery was completed and post-processed on an independent work station. 3D angiography revealed a superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm which measures 3.0 x 2.8 x 2.6 x 2.3 mm (axial by axial by neck-to-dome by neck). The internal carotid artery from the distal ophthalmic segment to the mid cavernous segment measures from 3.1 to 3.4 mm in diameter.    COMPLICATIONS: none immediate.  IMPRESSION:  1.\tSuccessful placement of pipeline embolization device in the right ICA for treatment of unruptured superior hypophyseal artery aneurysm. 2.\tMild iatrogenic catheter related vasospasm of the right ICA stenosis 3.\tNo evidence of residual or recurrent basilar apex aneurysm or left pericallosal aneurysm. 4.\tIndependent origin of the right subclavian artery, remote from the origin of the right common carotid artery. Common origin of the right and left common carotid arteries, which did not require reverse curve catheter for catheterization.",

    "text": "DIAGNOSTIC CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM  CLINICAL INDICATION: This is a 40 years Female with past medical history of heart failure, lupus, hypertension, COPD, with an incidental ACA aneurysm, status post balloon assisted coil embolization [DATE]. She now presents for follow-up diagnostic cerebral angiography.    PROCEDURE: Diagnostic cerebral angiogram.  DURATION OF PROCEDURE: Approximately 30 minutes.  OPERATORS: [HCW] was the attending physician who supervised the entire procedure and interpreted the images. [HCW] was the fellow.   VESSELS ANGIOGRAMMED: None  ANESTHESIA: Local in the right groin with bupivacaine. Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by the nurse present during the entire procedure. The patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Sedation was administered by a specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for the duration of the procedure as outlined above (Total intra service time, 30 min ). Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  MEDICATIONS:  0.5% Bupivacaine SQ 25 cc  Fentanyl 25 mcg IV  MATERIALS:  5 French micropuncture kit: Cope Mandril wire, 5 French transitional dilator, 21-gauge needle 0.038\" Bentson guidewire 5 French Terumo Pinnacle sheath 5 French Simmons 3 Glide catheter   TECHNIQUE: Prior to the procedure, the technical aspects of the procedure, as well as potential risks and benefits, were explained to the patient. Specifically, the risks of cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, blindness, cranial nerve palsy, facial pain, anaphylaxis, renal failure, limb loss, death, groin hematoma, arterial dissection, arterial pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula were discussed.   After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and prepped and draped in the usual fashion. We attempted to gain access to the right common femoral artery using ultrasound but were unable to despite several attempts. We did cannulate the common femoral vein using the microcatheter dilator, then removed the microcatheter dilator and held manual pressure for 10 minutes until adequate hemostasis was achieved. We then discussed with the patient different options done to proceed. Given the result of the aneurysm coiling during her treatment angiogram, we recommended that the patient first obtained an MRA time-of-flight time resolved. If that MRA were to show concern for recurrence, we could bring the patient back on a different date and attempt a transradial approach. The patient was agreeable to this plan and we aborted the procedure.  COMPLICATIONS: None immediate.  IMPRESSION: 1. Aborted diagnostic cerebral angiogram due to difficulty obtaining access into the right common femoral artery which was limited by body habitus. Plan to obtain MRA time-of-flight time resolved in the meantime and consider a radial approach in the future.  Charles M Cawley, MD, was present for the key and critical portions of the procedure and associated imaging guidance.",

No output from the drain.  Procedure:   1.\tFluoroscopic guided cholecystogram and cholecystostomy drain replacement  Findings:   1.\t Collapsed gallbladder body with filling of the proximal cystic duct there is no passage into the central cystic duct and into the common bile duct consistent with cystic duct occlusion. Perihepatic ascites.  Impression:   1.\t Technically successful image guided cholecystogram and replacement of cholecystostomy drain  Treatment Plan:   1. Drain to gravity drainage bag. Given collapsed gallbladder cavity, drainage may be minimal. Given perihepatic ascites, there may be leaking from around the drain skin site.  Technique:    The patient was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. The skin and underlying soft tissue was an exercise with 1% lidocaine. Contrast was injected through the existing cholecystostomy drain for a cholecystogram. An Amplatz wire was advanced through the existing drain and looped within the caudal gallbladder body. Upon removal of the existing drain over the guidewire, there was retraction of the tip of the Amplatz wire. An angled catheter was advanced over the wire, however the wire could not be removed through the catheter. The catheter and guidewire were removed together.   Using an angled catheter and Glidewire, the hepatic tract was catheterized and catheter advanced over the guidewire into the gallbladder body. Contrast was injected to confirm a stable position. Different guidewires (Amplatz) were used, however could not be adequately looped within the gallbladder body to advance a multipurpose drainage catheter. A Rosen guidewire was advanced into the gallbladder body, over which, an 8 French anchor drain (Malecot) was advanced. The anchor drain was locked within the gallbladder body and connected to gravity drainage bag and sutured to the skin with 2-0 Prolene suture. Contrast injection demonstrated appropriate positioning.   The patient tolerated the procedure without immediate consultation.   Procedural Personnel Attending(s): [HCW] Fellow(s): None Resident(s): None Advanced practice provider(s): None  Complications: No immediate complications.  Contrast: 30 mL Omnipaque  Fluoroscopy time: 13.9 minutes Fluoroscopy dose:  175.58 mGy  Conscious Sedation:  Preprocedure assessment (including review of history and physical and appropriate diagnostic tests) was performed, which documented that the patient was an appropriate candidate for conscious sedation. All vital signs were monitored and recorded by nurse present during the entire procedure. Patient returned to baseline mental status prior to transfer from the department. Administered by the specifically trained nurse under the direct supervision of the single attending physician noted above, conscious sedation was administered and actively monitored for a total of 25 minutes (Total intra service time).  Total medication dosages are listed separately within the body of the report.  Medications: Please see patient's electronic medical records for medications administered.  Antibiotics: Patient on antibiotics with appropriate coverage as an inpatient.  Blood loss:  Less than 10 ml  Checklist:\tInformed consent was obtained discussing the risks, benefits and alternatives to the planned procedure.  Pre-sedation H&P was performed and sedation consent obtained. The patient’s name, medical record number, date of birth, allergies, procedure being performed including site and pertinent laboratory values were reviewed and confirmed with the technologist, nurse and patient.  These requirements including the Time Out were met prior to initiating the procedure.",
